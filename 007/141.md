# Ignoring return value of `transfer()` can lead to silent failures in `pullSdStakingBribes()` function

## Summary
The function ignores the return value of `transfer()` when transferring tokens from the contract to the receiver or the processor. This can lead to silent failures if the transfer fails for any reason.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `pullSdStakingBribes()` calls `transfer()` twice in a loop without checking the return value. According to the ERC20 specification, `transfer()` should return a `boolean` value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. If the transfer fails, the function should revert or handle the error. However, the function does not check the return value and assumes that the transfer always succeeds. This can lead to silent failures if the transfer fails for any reason, such as insufficient balance, a revert in the token contract, or a non-compliant token implementation.

## Impact
A silent failure can have serious consequences for the functionality and security of the contract. For example, if the transfer fails, then the receiver or the processor will not receive the expected amount of tokens. Moreover, the function will return an incorrect array of token amounts, which can affect the accounting and logic of the contract.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid silent failures, check the return value of transfer() and revert or handle the error if the transfer fails. You can use `require()` to check the return value and revert with a message if the transfer fails.

            uint256 balance = bribeToken.balanceOf(address(this));

            if (balance != 0) {
                /// @dev send rewards to claimer
                uint256 claimerRewards = (balance * _processorRewardsPercentage) / 100_000;
                if (claimerRewards > 0) {
                    // Vulnerable line: ignoring return value of transfer

                   // Fixed line: checking return value of transfer
+                    require(bribeToken.transfer(_processor, claimerRewards), "Transfer failed");
                    balance -= claimerRewards;
                }

                /// @dev send the balance of the bribe token minus claimer rewards to the buffer
                // Vulnerable line: ignoring return value of transfer
-                bribeToken.transfer(sdtRewardReceiver, balance);
                // Fixed line: checking return value of transfer
+               require(bribeToken.transfer(sdtRewardReceiver, balance), "Transfer failed");

                _bribeTokensAmounts[i] = ICommonStruct.TokenAmount({token: bribeTokens[i], amount: balance});
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        return _bribeTokensAmounts;
    }
