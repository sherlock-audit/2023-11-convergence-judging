# Arbitrary from in `transferFrom()` can lead to unauthorized token transfers in `pullRewards()` function

## Summary
The code snippet is a function that pulls rewards from various sources and distributes them to the processor and the reward receiver. The function uses `transferFrom()` with an arbitrary from address, which can allow an attacker to transfer tokens without approval. This can result in a loss of funds for the original token holders and the reward receiver. To prevent this, use `msg.sender` as the from address or use `transfer()` instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `pullRewards()` calls `transferFrom()` twice with `veSdtMultisig` as the from address and different to addresses. This can allow an attacker to transfer tokens from `veSdtMultisig` to any address without having the allowance from `veSdtMultisig`. An attacker can exploit this by setting the to address to their own address and calling `pullRewards()` with a large `processorRewardsPercentage`. This can result in a loss of funds for `veSdtMultisig` and the reward receiver.

## Impact
An unauthorized token transfer can have serious consequences for the functionality and security of the contract. For example, if an attacker transfers all the tokens from `veSdtMultisig` to themselves, then the reward receiver will not receive any rewards. Moreover, an attacker can also manipulate the token balances and affect the value of the tokens.

## Recommendation
To prevent unauthorized token transfers, use `msg.sender` as the from address in `transferFrom()`. This ensures that only the approved sender can transfer tokens to the receiver. Alternatively, you can also use transfer() instead of `transferFrom()` if you donâ€™t need to use allowances. For example, you can change the code snippet to:
```diff
function pullRewards(address processor) external returns (ICommonStruct.TokenAmount[] memory) {
        ...
        /// @dev distributes if the balance is different from 0
        if (sdFrax3CrvAmount != 0) {
            /// @dev send rewards to claimer
            uint256 processorRewards = sdFrax3CrvAmount * _processorRewardsPercentage / DENOMINATOR;
            if (processorRewards != 0) {
                // Fixed line: use msg.sender as from in transferFrom
-              _sdFrax3Crv.transferFrom(veSdtMultisig, _processor, processorRewards); 
+              _sdFrax3Crv.transferFrom(msg.sender, _processor, processorRewards);
                sdFrax3CrvAmount -= processorRewards;
            }

            sdtRewardAssets[counter++] = ICommonStruct.TokenAmount({token: _sdFrax3Crv, amount: sdFrax3CrvAmount});
            ///@dev transfers from all tokens detained by veSdtMultisig
            // Fixed line: use msg.sender as from in transferFrom
-            _sdFrax3Crv.transferFrom(veSdtMultisig, sdtRewardReceiver, sdFrax3CrvAmount);
+          _sdFrax3Crv.transferFrom(msg.sender, sdtRewardReceiver, sdFrax3CrvAmount);
        }
        ...
    }
