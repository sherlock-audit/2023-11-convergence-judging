# Possible DoS happening when gauge weight is changing due to underflow of `pt.slope -= d_slope`

## Summary

Possible DoS happening when gauge weight is changing due to underflow of `pt.slope -= d_slope`

## Vulnerability Detail

Referencing one of Code4rena's [finding](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa-findings/issues/206) which is interesting to read, also it's [duplicates](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-verwa-findings/issues/386)

Seeing `_get_weight` on GaugeController, assuming `time_weight[gauge_addr]` less or equal `block.timestamp` then there are two possible case happening:

- pt.bias > d_bias (Line 380)
- pt.bias <= d_bias (else)

The first case will potentially always happen, since pt.bias will be the total voting power allocated for some point and since slope is a sum of all users' slopes.

also, it is possible to modify `points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias` by calling `change_gauge_weight` (gov only). `change_gauge_weight` can change the weight to a smaller number than its current value, so it's both perfectly normal that admin does this at some point.

Then the `else` will be entered, because `pt.bias` will be less than the sum of all user's biases (since originally these values were equal, but `pt.bias` was lowered by the governance). It will set `pt.bias` and `pt.slope` to 0.

Later, the governance may realise that the gauge's weight is 0, but should be bigger and may change it to some bigger value. Then the result is points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].slope = 0 and points_weight[_gauge_addr][t].bias > 0.

If this happens and there is any nonzero `changes_weight[_gauge_addr]` not yet taken into account, then all the functions related to the gauge at `_gauge_addr` will not work.

```

Copying from the code4rena finding, in short, the scenario is as follows:

1. Users allocate voting power to a gauge X.
2. Governance at some point decreases the weight of X.
3. Users withdraw their voting power as the time passes, and finally the weight of X drops to 0.
4. Governance increases weight of X in order to incentivise users to provide liquidity in X.
5. Voting power delegation of some user(s) ends some time after that and `_get_weight` attempts to subtract `changes_weight[_gauge_addr][t]` from the current slope (which is either 0 or some small value) and it results in integer underflow.
6. X is unusable and it's impossible to withdraw voting power from (so users cannot give their voting power somewhere else). The weight of X cannot be changed anymore and X cannot be even removed.

## Impact

the gauges will be useless, voting powers can possibly locked, and its weight is impossible to change

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform `pt.slope -= d_slope` in `_get_weight` only when `pt.slope >= d.slope` and otherwise zero it out.
