# `sdt` fees of a cycle may be distributed to the next cycle `cvgSdt` stakers

## Summary
`sdt` fees of a cycle may be distributed to the next cycle `cvgSdt` stakers depending on the timing of `processSdtRewards` calls.

## Vulnerability Detail
A percentage of earned sdt from sdStakers is given to the cvgSdt stakers. It gets collected when the `processSdtRewards` function is called on the respective staking contracts which can happen anytime after the cycle is updated. 
The cvgSdt stakers calim this reward by calling the `processSdtRewards` function in the cvgSdt contract. In the scenario where `processSdtRewards` of cvgSdt staking contract is called first, the cvgSdt stakers loose the sdt rewards of this cycle which is passed on to the next cycle. 
A user who has a large stake in the next cycle would be motivated to do this as the rewards would be distributed in the next cycle 

## Impact
Stakers of a cycle may loose their deserved share of sdt fees

## Code Snippet
`processSdtRewards` of cvgSdt can be called as soon as the cycle is updated and this calls `pullRewards` of `cvgSdt` buffer

The `sdt` reward is computed using the currently available `sdt` amount in the `sdtFeeCollector`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To account this the reward distribution mechanism of cvgSdt staking will have to be changed. Consider a mechanism which allows the buffer to pull sdt till the end of cycle
