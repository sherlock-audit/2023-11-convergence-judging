# No slippage tolerance amount for curve swaps

## Summary

There are a few places where curve swaps are executed without slippage tolerance, which could lead to malicious sandwiching. 

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, in `SdtRewardReceiver.sol` in `_withdrawRewards`:

We have: 

`_poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, _poolCvgSDT.get_dy(0, 1, rewardAmount), receiver);`

(For context rewardAmount is the SDT reward amount and we want to convert it to CvgSDT). The min amount out is calculated fully on chain, which means that this swap could be prone to sandwiching.

There are a few other swaps that are executed poorly but not as poorly. For example in `SdtUtilities`, in `convertAndStakeSdAsset`, we have:

```solidity
                if (crvPoolPlain.get_dy(0, 1, _assetAmount) > _assetAmount) {
                    crvPoolPlain.exchange(0, 1, _assetAmount, _assetAmount, address(this));
                }
```

This is still prone to sandwiching, as if `crvPoolPlain.get_dy(0, 1, _assetAmount)` is much more than `_assetAmount`, the sandwicher can make it so that the user gets only `_assetAmount` out instead of the higher amount they should get. 

## Impact

User's swaps can get maliciously sandwiched, leading to loss of money
