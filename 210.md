# The locked-amount and the voting power can still be increased even after the given `tokenId` of locking position NFT (ERC721) would be burned via the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()`

## Summary
Due to lack of logic to delete the record of the locking position from the `lockingPositions` storage, the **locked-amount** and the **voting power** can still be increased even after the given `tokenId` of locking position NFT (ERC721) would be burned via the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a new locking position would be minted, the LockingPositionService#`mintPosition()` would be called.
Within the `mintPosition()`, new `tokenId` would be stored into the `lockingPositions` storage and then the `tokenId` of locking position NFT (ERC721) would be minted like this:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Locking/LockingPositionService.sol#L309
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Mint a locking position (ERC721) for the user.
     * @dev Lock can't be greater than the Maximum locking time / The end of the lock must finish on a TDE event cycle |  The percentage of ys determines the repartition in veCVG,mgCVG/YsCVG.
     * @param lockDuration is the duration in cycle(week) of the lock.
     * @param amount is the amount of cvg to lock in the position.
     * @param ysPercentage percentage of lock dedicated to treasury shares (ysCVG).
     * @param receiver address of the receiver of the locking position.
     * @param isAddToManagedTokens add the created token in managed tokens(voting power)  directly.
     */
    function mintPosition(
        uint96 lockDuration,
        uint256 amount,
        uint64 ysPercentage,  /// @audit info - How much is % allocated to the ysCVG. (The remaining % is going to be the veCVG / mgCVG)
        address receiver,
        bool isAddToManagedTokens
    ) external onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract {
        ...
        LockingPosition memory lockingPosition = LockingPosition({
            startCycle: actualCycle,
            lastEndCycle: endLockCycle,
            totalCvgLocked: amount,
            mgCvgAmount: _mgCvgCreated,
            ysPercentage: ysPercentage
        });

        /** @dev Associate this Locking position on the tokenId. */
        lockingPositions[tokenId] = lockingPosition;  ///<--------------- @audit
        ...

        /** @dev Mint the ERC721 representing the user position. */
        _lockingPositionManager.mint(receiver); ///<--------------- @audit
       ...
```

On the other hand, when an existing locking position would be burned, the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()` would be called.
Within the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()`, the given `tokenId` of locking position NFT (ERC721) would be burned like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Locking/LockingPositionService.sol#L526
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Unlock CVG tokens under the NFT Locking Position : Burn the NFT, Transfer back the CVG to the user.  Rewards from YsDistributor must be claimed before or they will be lost.    * @dev The locking time must be over
     * @param tokenId to burn
     */
    function burnPosition(uint256 tokenId) external {
        ...
        /** @dev Burn the NFT representing the position. */
        _cvgControlTower.lockingPositionManager().burn(tokenId); ///<---------- @audit

        /** @dev Transfer CVG back to the user. */
        cvg.transfer(msg.sender, totalCvgLocked);
        ...
```

However, within the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()`, there is no logic to delete the `tokenId` from the `lockingPositions` storage. 
As a result, even if the given `tokenId` of locking position NFT (ERC721) would be burned via the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()`, the record of the locking position is still remaining in the `lockingPositions` storage.

This is problematic. Because the **locked-amount** and the **voting power** can still be increased unless the record of the locking position would remain in the `lockingPositions` storage even after the given `tokenId` of locking position NFT (ERC721) would be burned:

```solidity
    function increaseLockAmount(
        uint256 tokenId, /// @audit info - An existing tokenId
        uint256 amount,
        address operator
    ) external onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract {
        ...
        LockingPosition memory lockingPosition = lockingPositions[tokenId]; ///<--------- @audit
        ...

        uint256 _newVotingPower;
        /** @dev Update voting power through Curve contract, link voting power to the nft tokenId. */
        if (lockingPosition.ysPercentage != MAX_PERCENTAGE) {
            ...
            lockingPositions[tokenId].mgCvgAmount += _newVotingPower; ///<--------- @audit
        }

        /** @dev Update cvgLocked balance. */
        lockingPositions[tokenId].totalCvgLocked += amount;  ///<--------- @audit
```


## Impact
The **locked-amount** and the **voting power** can still be increased even after the given `tokenId` of locking position NFT (ERC721) would be burned via the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()`

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the LockingPositionService#`burnPosition()`, consider adding a logic to delete the `tokenId` from the `lockingPositions` storage like this:
```diff
    function burnPosition(uint256 tokenId) external {
        ...
        /** @dev Burn the NFT representing the position. */
        _cvgControlTower.lockingPositionManager().burn(tokenId); 

        /** @dev Transfer CVG back to the user. */
        cvg.transfer(msg.sender, totalCvgLocked);

+       delete lockingPositions[tokenId]; 
        ...
```
