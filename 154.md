# Dubious typecast can cause overflow or underflow in `stakingInflationAtCycle()` function

## Summary
The function casts a uint256 value to a uint128 value, which can cause overflow or underflow if the value exceeds the range of uint128.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `stakingInflationAtCycle()` casts a uint256 value to a uint128 value at line 248. The value is the length of the array gauges, which is a state variable that stores the addresses of the staking contracts. The function casts the value to a uint128 and assigns it to the variable `_totalGaugeNumber`. However, this cast can cause overflow or underflow if the value exceeds the range of uint128, which is 0 to 2^128 - 1. For example, if the length of the array is 2^128, then the cast will result in 0, which can affect the logic and calculations of the function.

## Impact
Dubious typecast can have negative consequences for the functionality and security of the contract. For example, if the cast causes overflow or underflow, then the variable `_totalGaugeNumber` will have an incorrect value, which can affect the loop condition and the inflation target calculation. This can result in a wrong or zero staking inflation for the cycle. This can affect the reward distribution and the incentive mechanism of the contract.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid overflow or underflow, do not cast a larger type to a smaller type. Use the same type or a larger type to store the value. Alternatively, you can also use a safe math library, such as OpenZeppelin, to perform safe casts.

       // Fixed line: using uint256 to store the value

        uint256 _endChunk = _maxEnd < _totalGaugeNumber ? _maxEnd : _totalGaugeNumber;

            cursor = 0;
            /// @dev set the step as DISTRIBUTE for reward distribution
            state = State.DISTRIBUTE;
        } else {
            /// @dev setup the cursor at the index start for the next chunk
            cursor = _endChunk;
        }

        totalWeightLocked += _gaugeController.get_gauge_weight_sum(_getGaugeChunk(_cursor, _endChunk));

        /// @dev emit the event only at the last chunk
        if (_endChunk == _totalGaugeNumber) {
