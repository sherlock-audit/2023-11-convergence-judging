# Precision loss in calculation of `_ysTotal` in `balanceOfYsCvgAt()` function

## Summary
The current implementation of the `_ysTotal` calculation in the `balanceOfYsCvgAt()` function introduces precision loss due to the sequence of divisions. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This function `balanceOfYsCvgAt()` is used to calculate the balance of `YsCVG` at a specific cycle for a given token ID.
In the current calculation of `_ysTotal`, there is a potential precision loss due to the sequence of divisions. The formula first divides by `MAX_PERCENTAGE` and then divides by `MAX_LOCK`. 
```solidity
                uint256 _ysTotal = (((_extension.endCycle - _extension.cycleId) *
                    _extension.cvgLocked *
                    _lockingPosition.ysPercentage) / MAX_PERCENTAGE) / MAX_LOCK;

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to modify the calculation to  `uint256 _ysTotal = (_extension.endCycle - _extension.cycleId) * _extension.cvgLocked * _lockingPosition.ysPercentage) / (MAX_LOCK * MAX_PERCENTAGE)`
