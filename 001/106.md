# Failure to update `mgCvgAmount` in `increaseLockTime()` function

## Summary
The `increaseLockTime()` function extends the lock duration for a user's position, but it fails to update the `mgCvgAmount` in the lockingPositions mapping. This omission results in users not receiving additional mgCVG, leading to a lack of voting power corresponding to the extended lock time.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `mintPosition()` is used to create a new locking position, representing a user's staked funds and associated benefits in the system.
In the function , the  `amountVote` is calculated as `amount * (MAX_PERCENTAGE - ysPercentage)`, representing the funds not allocated to yield-sharing.
```solidity
 uint256 amountVote = amount * (MAX_PERCENTAGE - ysPercentage);

            /** @dev Timestamp of the end of locking. */
            _cvgControlTower.votingPowerEscrow().create_lock(
                tokenId,
                amountVote / MAX_PERCENTAGE,
                block.timestamp + (lockDuration + 1) * 7 days
            );
            /// @dev compute the amount of mgCvg
            _mgCvgCreated = (amountVote * lockDuration) / (MAX_LOCK * MAX_PERCENTAGE);


```
In the `increaseLockTime()` function, the lock duration is extended, but the `mgCvgAdded` value, which represents the more yield-sharing rewards added to the user's voting power, is not increased. This leads to a situation where the user's voting power does not receive additional rewards proportional to the extension of the lock duration.
```solidity

  if (lockingPosition.ysPercentage != 0) {
            /** @dev Retrieve the balance registered at the cycle where the ysBalance is supposed to drop. */
            uint256 _ysToReport = balanceOfYsCvgAt(tokenId, oldEndCycle - 1);
            /** @dev Add this value to the tracking on the oldEndCycle. */
            totalSuppliesTracking[oldEndCycle].ysToAdd += _ysToReport;
            /** @dev Report this value in the newEndCycle in the Sub part. */
            totalSuppliesTracking[newEndCycle].ysToSub += _ysToReport;
        }

        /** @dev Vote part, access here only if some % has been given to ve/mg on the NFT. */
        if (lockingPosition.ysPercentage != MAX_PERCENTAGE) {
            /** @dev Increase Locking time to a new timestamp, computed with the cycle. */
            _cvgControlTower.votingPowerEscrow().increase_unlock_time(
                tokenId,
                block.timestamp + ((newEndCycle - actualCycle) * 7 days)
            );
        }

        /** @dev Update the new end cycle on the locking position. */
        lockingPosition.lastEndCycle = uint96(newEndCycle - 1);

        emit IncreaseLockTime(tokenId, lockingPosition, oldEndCycle - 1);

```


## Impact

`lockingPositions[tokenId].mgCvgAmount` is not updated, resulting in the user not receiving additional voting power.

## Recommendation

Update the value of mgCvgAmount in the increaseLockTime function.
```solidity
            uint256 amountVote = amount * (MAX_PERCENTAGE - lockingPosition.ysPercentage);
            _newVotingPower = (amountVote * durationAdd) / (MAX_LOCK * MAX_PERCENTAGE);
            lockingPositions[tokenId].mgCvgAmount += _newVotingPower;


```
