# A token owner cannot remove one mgCvg delegation when he already delegates to `maxMgDelegatees` addresses.

## Summary
A token owner cannot remove one mgCvg delegation when he already delegates to `maxMgDelegatees` addresses, which violates the functionality of `delegateMgCvg` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
A token owner can delegate his mgCvg to up to `maxMgDelegatees` addresses through `delegateMgCvg` function. This function can also be used to remove a delegation by setting parameter `_percentage` to 0 (L273). The removing works fine when the number of delegatees is less than `maxMgDelegatees`. If the token owner already delegates his mgCvg to `maxMgDelegatees` addresses, he cannot remove one specific delegation with `delegateMgCvg`, as the number of existing delegatees is required less than `maxMgDelegatees` at the begining of `delegateMgCvg` function (L282). This is inconsistent with the functionality of `delegateMgCvg` function.

278:    function delegateMgCvg(uint256 _tokenId, address _to, uint96 _percentage) external onlyTokenOwner(_tokenId) {
279:        require(_percentage <= 100, "INVALID_PERCENTAGE");
280:
281:        uint256 _delegateesLength = delegatedMgCvg[_tokenId].length;

```

POC: Let's add a new test case to `sherlock-cvg/test/ut/delegation/manage-delegation.spec.ts` to show this.
```TypeScript
// File: sherlock-cvg/test/ut/delegation/manage-delegation.spec.ts

    it ("Delegates mgCvg to maxMgDelegatees and remove a delegation", async () => {
        // delegate mgCvg to 5 users to reach `maxMgDelegatees`
        await lockingPositionDelegate.connect(user1).delegateMgCvg(1, user4, 10);
        await lockingPositionDelegate.connect(user1).delegateMgCvg(1, user5, 10);
        await lockingPositionDelegate.connect(user1).delegateMgCvg(1, user6, 10);
        await lockingPositionDelegate.connect(user1).delegateMgCvg(1, user7, 10);
        await lockingPositionDelegate.connect(user1).delegateMgCvg(1, user8, 10);

        // remove one delegation through `delegateMgCvg` with 0 percentage -> revert
        await lockingPositionDelegate.connect(user1).delegateMgCvg(1, user6, 0).should.be.revertedWith("TOO_MUCH_DELEGATEES");

        // only able to remove one delegation by clean all delegations
        await lockingPositionDelegate.connect(user1).cleanDelegatees(1, false, true);
    });
```
In such case, token owner has to remove all the delegations first, and then add other delegations again except the one he wants to remove.


## Impact
A token owner cannot remove one mgCvg delegation when he already delegates to `maxMgDelegatees` addresses, which violates the functionality of `delegateMgCvg` function.
