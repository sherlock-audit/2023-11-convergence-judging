# Transferring a CvgERC721 does not clear delegations

## Summary
After transferring a CvgERC721, the new owner may not be aware that the token is delegated and some people can vote with it

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can choose to delegate their voting power. By doing so, they allow for other users to use the power associated with the token for whatever they like. Upon transfer the delegations are not cleared and old delegatees can still make use of the token. If the new owner is not aware, it could result in bad behaviour and cause unexpected voting results. 
```solidity
    function delegateVeCvg(uint256 _tokenId, address _to) external onlyTokenOwner(_tokenId) {
        require(veCvgDelegatees[_to].length < maxTokenIdsDelegated, "TOO_MUCH_VE_TOKEN_ID_DELEGATED");
        /** @dev Find if this tokenId is already delegated to an address. */
        address previousOwner = delegatedVeCvg[_tokenId];
        if (previousOwner != address(0)) {
            /** @dev If it is  we remove the previous delegation.*/
            uint256 _toIndex = getIndexForVeDelegatee(previousOwner, _tokenId);
            uint256 _delegateesLength = veCvgDelegatees[previousOwner].length;
            /** @dev Removing delegation.*/
            veCvgDelegatees[previousOwner][_toIndex] = veCvgDelegatees[previousOwner][_delegateesLength - 1];
            veCvgDelegatees[previousOwner].pop();
        }

        /** @dev Associate tokenId to a new delegated address.*/
        delegatedVeCvg[_tokenId] = _to;

        if (_to != address(0)) {
            /** @dev Add delegation to the new address.*/
            veCvgDelegatees[_to].push(_tokenId);
        }
        emit DelegateVeCvg(_tokenId, _to);
    }

```
