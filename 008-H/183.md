# Delegated Sub-assets Persist After Position Transfer

## Summary

The `delegateYsCvg(tokenId, address(0))` and `cleanDelegatees(tokenId, true, true)` functions have not been called when changing the owner of a locking position.

The old delegatee can still utilize delegated sub-assets even after the ownership of the NFT has changed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LockingPositionDelegate` contract manages the delegation of VeCvg, YsCvg, and MgCvg for locking positions, which are NFTs that can have their ownership transferred.

However, the transferring process does not remove the old delegatee since there is no implementation to override the related transfer function.

This results in the old delegatee retaining the ability to use the power of the sub-assets of the locking position, even if the new owner has not been delegated to yet.

## Impact

The old delegatee can still wield the power of the sub-assets of the locking position without the consent of the new owner.

## Tool used

Visual Studio Code / Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call the `delegateYsCvg(tokenId, address(0))` and `cleanDelegatees()` functions before or after changing the owner of the locking position to remove the old delegation from the locking position.
