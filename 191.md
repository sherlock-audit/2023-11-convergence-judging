# SdtStakingPositionManager NFT doesn't claim rewards before burning

## Summary

SdtStakingPositionManager NFT doesn't claim rewards before burning, which could lead to loss of user rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

In `SdtStakingPositionManager`, this is what the burn function looks like:

```solidity
    function burn(uint256 _tokenId) external onlyNftOwner(_tokenId) {
        require(
            ISdtStakingPositionService(stakingPerTokenId[_tokenId]).tokenTotalStaked(_tokenId) == 0,
            "TOTAL_STAKED_NOT_EMPTY"
        );
        _burn(_tokenId);
    }
```

The function is clearly designed to prevent users from losing funds, since it checks that the total staked amount for the tokenId is 0. However, even if the total staked amount is 0, there could be rewards left to claim (e.g. user deposited, withdrew later, but hasn't claimed rewards yet). The burn function does not check this and also does not claim them on the users behalf. 

Furthermore, after the NFT is burned, the user will be unable to claim rewards with that `tokenId`, since `claimCvgSdtRewards` in `StdStakingPositionService.sol` for example calls `checkCompliance(_tokenId)` which requires the `tokenId` to exist. 

## Impact

User rewards could be trapped because the NFT is burned before rewards are claimed

## Recommendation
Either call claim rewards before nft is burned or prevent user from burning nft if there are rewards to be claimed
