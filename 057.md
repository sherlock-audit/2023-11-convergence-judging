# [H] Wrong balanceOfMgCvgAt due to wrong boundary checks

## Summary
The function balanceOfMgCvgAt is providing the wrong balance at certain queried cycles.

## Vulnerability Detail
The boundaries in the following boundary checks are wrongly set.

And

The current implementation for instance provides the wrong mgCvgBalance when queried at “startCycle”. When queried at “startCycle” the “mgCvgBalance” should be “0”, but instead it is the one registered in the first locking extension.

## Impact
The impact varies based on how the caller of the functions balanceOfMgCvgAt or balanceOfMgCvg utilizes the provided information.

## Code Snippet
None. See links above. 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
For getting the correct mgCvgBalance, the implementation regarding the boundary checks should be like the corresponding lines in function “balanceOfYsCvgAt”.
