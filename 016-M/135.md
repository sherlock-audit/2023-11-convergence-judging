# CvgRewards::_checkpoints Timing Inaccuracy Causes Extended Lock Durations Beyond Expected Cycle

## Summary

`CvgRewards::_checkpoints` uses a timing condition `lastUpdatedTimestamp + 7 days <= block.timestamp` to determine the transition to the next cycle. This approach introduces incremental delays in cycle advancement, as the condition is not met precisely at `lastUpdatedTimestamp + 7 days == block.timestamp`.
Consequently, positions locked at the start of a cycle for an extended duration will end up being locked longer than the duration defined by the underlying veCvg, affecting users' expectations and strategies regarding asset management and staking.

## Vulnerability Detail

The timing mechanism in `CvgRewards::_checkpoints` does not precisely align with the cycle duration due to the fact the operation is not carried out exactly when `lastUpdatedTimestamp + 7 days == block.timestamp`.
This misalignment, over time, results in a gradual extension of the lock period beyond the intended cycle length.

### Scenario:

- User Bob locks his tokens at the beginning of cycle N for a long duration.
- Due to the incremental delay in cycle transition, the lock period extends slightly beyond the expected end of cycle N+X.
- Bob's tokens remain locked for a duration longer than his initial expectation based on the veCvg period.

## Impact
Users locking their assets at the cycle's start for a lengthy period find their assets locked for a duration that slightly exceeds the underlying veCvg's specified lock period.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Use `lastUpdatedTimestamp = (block.timestamp % WEEK)` instead of `lastUpdatedTimestamp = block.timestamp` in `_triggerCvgCycle` to ensure a more precise alignment with the intended cycle lengths, providing users with a consistent and predictable locking and unlocking schedule for their assets.
