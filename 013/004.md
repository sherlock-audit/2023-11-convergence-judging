# encoded-packed-collision

## Summary
LockingPositionManager.tokenURI(uint256) calls abi.encodePacked() with multiple dynamic arguments:
- string(abi.encodePacked(localBaseURI,Strings.toString(tokenId))
## Vulnerability Detail
This can trigger hash collisions in the Eternal Storage pattern, alter the meaning of signatures, and result in collisions when used as a mapping key.
## Impact
Hash collisions that compromise the system which may lead to loss of integrity, wrong authorization and even loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
According to solidity documentation, if you use abi.encodePacked for signatures, authentication or data integrity, make sure to always use the same types and check that at most one of them is dynamic. Unless there is a compelling reason, abi.encode should be preferred. Do not use more than one dynamic type in abi.encodePacked(). Instead,use abi.encode() preferably.
