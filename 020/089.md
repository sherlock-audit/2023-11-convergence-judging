# Missing input validation in `setMaxLockingTime` function

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Token/CvgERC721TimeLockingUpgradeable.sol#L54

The smart contract lacks a critical validation check in the `setMaxLockingTime` function. Specifically, it does not ensure that the `newMaxLockingTime` is greater than a predefined `BUFFER` value. This omission can lead to inconsistencies and potential vulnerabilities in the contract's time-lock functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `setMaxLockingTime` function, the contract allows the owner to set a new maximum locking time (`newMaxLockingTime`) without validating that this new value is greater than the `BUFFER`. This lack of validation poses a risk, as the `setLock` function relies on `maxLockingTime` being greater than `BUFFER` to function correctly. The relevant code snippet is:

```solidity
function setMaxLockingTime(uint256 newMaxLockingTime) external onlyOwner {
    maxLockingTime = newMaxLockingTime; //@audit should be more then BUFFER
}
```

The `setLock` function has two require statements that depend on `maxLockingTime` being greater than `BUFFER`:

```solidity
require(timestamp >= block.timestamp + BUFFER, "TIME_BUFFER");
require(timestamp - block.timestamp < maxLockingTime, "MAX_TIME_LOCK");
```

Without the necessary validation in `setMaxLockingTime`, these requirements in `setLock` will revert call of this function.

## Impact

The absence of this validation check can lead to scenarios where users are not able to set lock times.

## Code Snippet

The issue is present in the following function:

```solidity
function setMaxLockingTime(uint256 newMaxLockingTime) external onlyOwner {
    maxLockingTime = newMaxLockingTime; //@audit should be more then BUFFER
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a validation check in the `setMaxLockingTime` function to ensure that `newMaxLockingTime` is greater than `BUFFER`. This will align the function's behavior with the intended logic and constraints of the contract, thereby enhancing its security and reliability.
