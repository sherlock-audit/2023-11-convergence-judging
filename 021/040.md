# cvg token loss for users claiming cvgRewards

## Summary
There is a presence  of precision loss in [SdtStakingPositionService.claimCvgRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L338) that will lead to users receiving less staking rewards(cvg).

## Vulnerability Detail
 [SdtStakingPositionService.claimCvgRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L338) function will cause a loss of precision when calculating the claimable amount. This [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L366-L368) is where the issue happens.

For example if 
- tokenStaked = 157
- _cycleInfo[lastClaimedCycle].cvgRewardsAmount = 100
- _cycleInfo[lastClaimedCycle].totalStaked = 1000 
- claimableAmount will be (157*100)/1000 // it will return 15 instead of 15.7 because of solidity truncation
-
## Impact
Users will get less rewards than they should, on thye long run these small amount ( in our example 15.7-15 = 0.7) will be accumulated and will be huge.
