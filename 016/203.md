# Allowance is not set to zero first before approving

## Summary

`approveTokens` did not Approve to zero first. Some ERC20 tokens like USDT require resetting the approval to 0 first before being able to reset it to another value.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some non-standard ERC20 tokens, such as USDT, require approve 0 first, otherwise they will revert. The `approveTokens` method in `SdtUtilities` is not handling this case which makes the modules incompatible with these tokens.

```js
File: SdtUtilities.sol
214:     function approveTokens(TokenSpender[] calldata _tokenSpenders) external onlyOwner {
215:         for (uint256 i; i < _tokenSpenders.length; ) {
216:             IERC20(_tokenSpenders[i].token).approve(_tokenSpenders[i].spender, _tokenSpenders[i].amount);
217:             unchecked {
218:                 ++i;
219:             }
220:         }
221:     }
```

On Readme, it states, it will support USDT, thus this issue should be a valid medium one.

## Impact

SdtUtilities is not compatible with certain ERC20 tokens for example USDT

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance.
