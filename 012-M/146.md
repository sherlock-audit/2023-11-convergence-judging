# YsDistributor lacks status synchronization, which will result in users not being able to obtain rewards and rewards being locked.

## Summary

The lack of status synchronization between depositing rewards and obtaining rewards in YsDistributor will cause users who obtain rewards before depositing rewards to no longer be able to obtain rewards, and unobtainable rewards will be locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Normal reward issuance is to deposit the reward first, and then the user obtains it.
But in the YsDistributor contract, there is no control state for reward deposit ([depositMultipleToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/e894be3e36614a385cf409dc7e278d5b8f16d6f2/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L101-L140)) and ([claimRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/e894be3e36614a385cf409dc7e278d5b8f16d6f2/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L155-L195)) reward acquisition. This means that before the reward is deposited, the user can call reward acquisition. 

From the claimRewards and _claimTokenRewards functions, we can see that there is no limit on the amount. Even if tokens.length = 0 and _amountUser is 0, it can be executed successfully.

```solidity
    function _claimTokenRewards(uint256 tokenId, uint256 tdeId, uint256 share, address receiver) internal {
        address[] memory tokens = depositedTokenAddressForTde[tdeId];
        TokenAmount[] memory tokensClaimable = new TokenAmount[](tokens.length);

        for (uint256 i; i < tokens.length; ) {
            IERC20 _token = IERC20(tokens[i]);
            uint256 _amountUser = _calculateUserRewardAmount(tdeId, _token, share);

            tokensClaimable[i] = TokenAmount({token: _token, amount: _amountUser});

            _token.safeTransfer(receiver, _amountUser);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        emit TokensClaim(tokenId, tdeId, share, tokensClaimable);
    }
```

Even if the user does not get anything, he cannot get rewards again, because at the end of getting rewards:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/e894be3e36614a385cf409dc7e278d5b8f16d6f2/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L194
```solidity
rewardsClaimedForToken[tokenId][tdeId] = true;
```

There are also restrictions when entering again to obtain rewards. Rewards that have been obtained cannot be obtained again:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/e894be3e36614a385cf409dc7e278d5b8f16d6f2/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L179
```solidity
require(!rewardsClaimedForToken[tokenId][tdeId], "ALREADY_CLAIMED");
```

As can be seen from the code below, rewards can be deposited in advance or delayed, and the latest is _actualCycle % TDE_DURATION == 0
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/e894be3e36614a385cf409dc7e278d5b8f16d6f2/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L102-L105
```solidity
        uint256 _actualCycle = cvgControlTower.cvgCycle();
        uint256 _actualTDE = _actualCycle % TDE_DURATION == 0
            ? _actualCycle / TDE_DURATION
            : (_actualCycle / TDE_DURATION) + 1;
```

There will be no problem if the reward is deposited in advance, but the situation mentioned above will occur if the reward is deposited later.

## Impact

Rewards that users cannot obtain are locked in the contract and cannot be obtained again. The YsDistributor contract does not have a withdrawal function.

This situation can easily occur if the reward storage personnel do not notice this situation. so the impact is High

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In addition to status restrictions, before the deposit of rewards is completed, the rewards are not allowed to be obtained or the rewards are limited based on the amount. If the amount of rewards that can be obtained is greater than 0, the user will be allowed to obtain them.
