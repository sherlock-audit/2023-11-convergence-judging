# User can claim all rewards while other users will be left with no rewards

## Summary
The identified issue highlights the absence of a check for double claims within the same cycle in the rewards function. Without this check, users, including Alice, could potentially exploit the system by calling the function multiple times within a single cycle, claiming rewards each time.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the oversight of not implementing a check to prevent users from claiming rewards multiple times within a single cycle. This oversight allows users to exploit the system and gain an unfair advantage in reward accumulation.

```solidity
 function claimCvgRewards(uint256 tokenId) external checkCompliance(tokenId) {
        uint128 actualCycle = stakingCycle;

        uint128 lastClaimedCvg = _lastClaims[tokenId].lastClaimedCvg;
        uint128 lastClaimedSdt = _lastClaims[tokenId].lastClaimedSdt;
        /// @dev As claim claimCvgSdtRewards claims always all Cvg on each cycle.
        ///      If the last claim action is a CvgSdt claim, we consider it also as the last cvg cycle claimed.
        ///      Else we take the lastClaimed on Cvg.
        uint128 lastClaimedCycle = lastClaimedCvg < lastClaimedSdt ? lastClaimedSdt : lastClaimedCvg;
        uint256 lengthHistory = _stakingHistoryByToken[tokenId].length;

        /// @dev If never claimed on this token
        if (lastClaimedCycle == 0) {
            /// @dev Get the length of the history
            lastClaimedCycle = uint128(_stakingHistoryByToken[tokenId][0]);
        }

        require(actualCycle > lastClaimedCycle, "ALL_CVG_CLAIMED_FOR_NOW");

        uint256 _totalAmount;
        for (; lastClaimedCycle < actualCycle; ) {
            /// @dev Retrieve the staked amount at the iterated cycle for this Staking position
            uint256 tokenStaked = _stakedAmountEligibleAtCycle(lastClaimedCycle, tokenId, lengthHistory);
            uint256 claimableAmount;
            /// @dev If no staked amount are eligible to rewards on the iterated cycle.
            if (tokenStaked != 0) {
                /// @dev Computes the staking share of the Staking Position compare to the total Staked.
                ///      By multiplying this share by the total CVG distributed for the cycle, we get the claimable amount.
                claimableAmount =
                    (tokenStaked * _cycleInfo[lastClaimedCycle].cvgRewardsAmount) /
                    _cycleInfo[lastClaimedCycle].totalStaked;
                /// @dev increments the total amount in CVG to mint to the user
                _totalAmount += claimableAmount;
            }

            unchecked {
                ++lastClaimedCycle;
            }
        }
        require(_totalAmount > 0, "NO_CVG_TO_CLAIM");

        /// @dev set the cycle as claimed for the NFT
        _lastClaims[tokenId].lastClaimedCvg = actualCycle;

        /// @dev mint CVG to user
        cvg.mintStaking(msg.sender, _totalAmount);

        emit ClaimCvgMultiple(tokenId, msg.sender);
    }
```

Suppose Alice has staked a significant amount and is eligible for rewards in the current cycle. Without a double claim check, Alice could call the rewards function multiple times within the same cycle:
```solidity
// Potentially exploitable code without a double claim check
claimCvgRewards();  // Alice claims rewards for the first time
claimCvgRewards();  // Alice claims rewards again within the same cycle
This scenario allows Alice to claim rewards multiple times within the same cycle, leading to an unfair advantage.
```

## Impact
The impact of this finding is significant as it opens the door for users to exploit the system and claim rewards excessively within the same cycle.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check to ensure that a user can only claim rewards once per cycle. Something like this
```solidity
require(lastClaimedCycle < actualCycle - 1, "ALREADY_CLAIMED_THIS_CYCLE");
```
