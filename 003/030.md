# Killing a gauge will result in mismatch between a gauge type's sum and the gauges' weights summed

## Summary
Killing a gauge will break accounting within the `GaugeController`

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon admin's decision, a gauge can be killed within the `GaugeController`. This would result in the gauge's weight being set to 0 and users being unable to vote towards the gauge.  However, it would also break all internal accounting and would cause mismatch between a gauge_type's sum and the actual real sum of the weight of all gauges of that type. 

```vyper
@internal
def _change_gauge_weight(addr: address, weight: uint256):
    # Change gauge weight
    # Only needed when testing in reality
    gauge_type: int128 = self.gauge_types_[addr] - 1
    old_gauge_weight: uint256 = self._get_weight(addr)
    type_weight: uint256 = self._get_type_weight(gauge_type)
    old_sum: uint256 = self._get_sum(gauge_type)
    _total_weight: uint256 = self._get_total()
    next_time: uint256 = (block.timestamp + WEEK) / WEEK * WEEK

    self.points_weight[addr][next_time].bias = weight
    self.time_weight[addr] = next_time

    new_sum: uint256 = old_sum + weight - old_gauge_weight
    self.points_sum[gauge_type][next_time].bias = new_sum
    self.time_sum[gauge_type] = next_time

    _total_weight = _total_weight + new_sum * type_weight - old_sum * type_weight
    self.points_total[next_time] = _total_weight
    self.time_total = next_time

    log NewGaugeWeight(addr, block.timestamp, weight, _total_weight)
```

When killing the gauge and effectively setting its weight to 0, we only change the bias of the gauge and the bias of the `gauge_type`. However, no changes to the slopes are made. This is not a problem for the gauge's slope as the gauge is killed and cannot have any voting power, but will actually result in breaking of internal accounting for the `gauge_type`. The `gauge_type` will keep on decreasing with the already killed gauge's slope. Meaning that over time, the gauge_type will be reduced twice the killed gauge's weight. 

Any functions depending on the sum of the `gauge_type` will not work properly.


## Impact
Anything depending on a gauge_type's sum will not work properly

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Upon killing a gauge, loop through its slope changes and remove them for the gauge's  `self.changes_sum[gauge_type][t]`
