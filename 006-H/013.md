# increaseLockTime does not calculate new `mgCvg` voting power

## Summary
increaseLockTime does not calculate new `mgCvg` voting power 

## Vulnerability Detail
When users create a voting escrow, they receive `mgCvg` balance which is calculated by the amount they've escrowed and the duration they've escrowed it for:
`_mgCvgCreated = (amountVote * lockDuration) / (MAX_LOCK * MAX_PERCENTAGE);`

The users then can call `increaseLockTime` to increase their voting power. As their lock time is increased, their `mgCvg` voting power should also be increased, but this actually does not happen nowhere within the `increaseLockTime`.
```solidity
    function increaseLockTime(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 durationAdd
    ) external checkCompliance(tokenId, address(0)) onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract {
        ICvgControlTower _cvgControlTower = cvgControlTower;
        /** @dev Retrieve actual staking cycle. */
        uint128 actualCycle = _cvgControlTower.cvgCycle();

        LockingPosition storage lockingPosition = lockingPositions[tokenId];
        uint256 oldEndCycle = lockingPosition.lastEndCycle + 1;
        uint256 newEndCycle = oldEndCycle + durationAdd;

        /** @dev Not possible extend a lock in duration after it's expiration. */
        require(oldEndCycle > actualCycle, "LOCK_TIME_OVER");

        /** @dev Not possible to have an active lock longer than the MAX_LOCK. */
        require(newEndCycle - actualCycle - 1 <= MAX_LOCK, "MAX_LOCK_96_CYCLES");

        /** @dev As the oldEnd cycle is a xTDE_DURATION. */
        /** @dev We just need to verify that the time we add is a xTDE_DURATION to ensure new lock is ending on a xTDE_DURATION. */
        require(durationAdd % TDE_DURATION == 0, "NEW_END_MUST_BE_TDE_MULTIPLE");

        /** @dev YsCvg TotalSupply Part, access only if some % has been given to ys on the NFT. */
        if (lockingPosition.ysPercentage != 0) {
            /** @dev Retrieve the balance registered at the cycle where the ysBalance is supposed to drop. */
            uint256 _ysToReport = balanceOfYsCvgAt(tokenId, oldEndCycle - 1);
            /** @dev Add this value to the tracking on the oldEndCycle. */
            totalSuppliesTracking[oldEndCycle].ysToAdd += _ysToReport;
            /** @dev Report this value in the newEndCycle in the Sub part. */
            totalSuppliesTracking[newEndCycle].ysToSub += _ysToReport;
        }

        /** @dev Vote part, access here only if some % has been given to ve/mg on the NFT. */
        if (lockingPosition.ysPercentage != MAX_PERCENTAGE) {
            /** @dev Increase Locking time to a new timestamp, computed with the cycle. */
            _cvgControlTower.votingPowerEscrow().increase_unlock_time(
                tokenId,
                block.timestamp + ((newEndCycle - actualCycle) * 7 days)
            );
        }

        /** @dev Update the new end cycle on the locking position. */
        lockingPosition.lastEndCycle = uint96(newEndCycle - 1);

        emit IncreaseLockTime(tokenId, lockingPosition, oldEndCycle - 1);
    }
```

In a scenario where two users have escrowed the same amount of tokens for the same amount of time, the one who has first locked them for a shorter period and then increased their lock time, will have significantly less voting power, despite both users locking the same amount of tokens for the same amount of time. 

## Impact
Loss of voting power
