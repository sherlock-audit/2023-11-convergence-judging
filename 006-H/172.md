# When increasing lock time, the voting power isnt increased

## Summary
in #lockingPositonService.increaseLockTime , the time to lock up tokens can be increased, however the voting power which is tracked through mgCvg isnt 
## Vulnerability Detail
when you first lock CVG in order to mint a locking position in the form of erc721 you receive mgCvg which comes from two steps 
first :` uint256 amountVote = amount * (MAX_PERCENTAGE - ysPercentage);`
second: `_mgCvgCreated = (amountVote * lockDuration) / (MAX_LOCK * MAX_PERCENTAGE);`

here we are able to see that _mgCvgCreated comes from how long you lock up your tokens through lockDuration

this isnt taken to account to account when increasing the lock duration.
## Impact
users lose some of their voting power if the choose to extend the time to lock up their tokens
