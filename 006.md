# arbitrary-send-erc20

## Summary
If an arbitrary from address can be passed to the transferFrom function without proper validation, it may allow an attacker to initiate token transfers from any address to the address(this) (the contract's address). This can result in unauthorized transfers of CVG tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
CvgAirdrop.claim(bytes32[]) uses arbitrary from in transferFrom: cvg.transferFrom(treasuryAirdrop,address(this),CLAIM)
## Impact
Since this vulnerability is in the context of an airdrop claim (CvgAirdrop.claim), an attacker might manipulate or abuse the airdrop distribution by claiming tokens on behalf of arbitrary addresses.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `msg.sender` as `from` in transferFrom.
