# Incorrect slippage protection for sdt/cvgSdt exchange

## Summary
Incorrect slippage protection for sdt/cvgSdt exchange in when withdrawing rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
The minimum amount required is incorrectly passed as the `current expected swap amount` instead of `input amount` when exchanging from sdt to cvgSdt in the `_withdrawRewards()` function
```solidity
                        ICrvPoolPlain _poolCvgSDT = poolCvgSDT;
                        /// @dev Only swap if the returned amount in CvgSdt is gretear than the amount rewarded in SDT
                        _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, _poolCvgSDT.get_dy(0, 1, rewardAmount), receiver);
```

## Impact
User's who opt to convert sdt to cvgSdt when cliaming rewards will be front-runned causing loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pass rewardAmount instead
```diff
+++ _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, rewardAmount, receiver);
--- _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, _poolCvgSDT.get_dy(0, 1, rewardAmount), receiver);
```
