# Using the predicted value as Minimum amount of reward to receive may result in user losses

## Summary
`_withdrawRewards()` function in SdtRewardReceiver.sol calls ` _poolCvgsdt.exchage()`  converts all SDT into CvgSDT.
The `poolCvgsdt.exchage()` function uses the return value of the `get_dy()` method as min_dy(Minimum amount of 'reward' to receive) may result in user losses.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://etherscan.io/address/0xCA0253A98D16e9C1e3614caFDA19318EE69772D0#code#L769
In` poolCvgsdt.exchange() `function compares the  calculated `'rewardAmount'` with the minimum `rewardAmount(min_dy)`, forcing the actual `'rewardAmount'` of received to be greater than or equal to `min_dy`.


However,  the `poolCvgsdt.exchage() `function uses the return value of the `get_dy()` method as `min_dy,`
 Curve `pool.get_dy()` method returns a predicted value that may be less than the user expects(actual rewardAmount)

As in the code comments “Only swap if the returned amount in CvgSdt is gretear than the amount rewarded in SDT”, This is to avoid losses to the user

## Impact
Leads to loss of rewards for users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use actual `'rewardAmount'` as `min_dy`
```solidity
ICrvPoolPlain _poolCvgSDT = poolCvgSDT;
/// @dev Only swap if the returned amount in CvgSdt is gretear than the amount rewarded in SDT
- _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, _poolCvgSDT.get_dy(0, 1, rewardAmount), receiver);

+ _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, rewardAmount, receiver);
```
