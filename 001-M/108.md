# Curve token swap will likely to fail because fee and slippage consideration are excluded

## Summary
Token swap in Curve Finance will likely to fail because it does not consider fee and slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code does not account for slippage or trading fees. It uses the output from get_dy to directly set the minimum acceptable output in the exchange function. However, get_dy only provides an estimate and does not include potential slippage or fees incurred during the swap.

## Impact
Due to the lack of slippage and fee consideration, there's a significant risk that the actual output of the swap will be less than the input amount, leading the transaction to fail. This can result in wasted gas fees and a failed swap.

## Recommendation
Introduce a slippage tolerance percentage to calculate the minimum acceptable output amount.
