# The slippage protection in `_poolCvgSDT.exchange()` is ineffective and does not provide the intended safeguard

## Summary
The `claimCvgSdtRewards()` function in the protocol is susceptible to sandwich attacks, exposing users to potential financial losses. This vulnerability arises from the lack of effective slippage protection when executing token swaps, allowing malicious actors to exploit price fluctuations during the transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
This internal function `_withdrawRewards()` is responsible for minting accumulated rewards and claiming StakeDao (SDT) rewards for a given user.In the function,If `isMint` is false, it performs a swap on the CvgToke contract.
```solidity
 {
         ICrvPoolPlain _poolCvgSDT = poolCvgSDT;
         /// @dev Only swap if the returned amount in CvgSdt is gretear than the amount rewarded in SDT
         _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, _poolCvgSDT.get_dy(0, 1, rewardAmount), receiver);
 }

```

```solidity
   function exchange(
        int128 i, //index tokenIn
        int128 j, //index tokenOut
        uint256 dx, //amountIn
        uint256 min_dy, //amountOut
        address receiver
    ) external;

```
The parameter `_poolCvgSDT.get_dy(0, 1, rewardAmount)` is intended to represent the `min_dy`, which is typically used as a measure to protect against slippage during token exchanges. However, it has been observed that in the protocol's execution, the calculated `min_dy` value does not effectively serve its intended purpose of providing slippage protection. This means that even though the protocol calculates this value, it doesn't actively utilize it to safeguard against potential price slippage during token swaps.

## Impact
Users may be vulnerable to sandwich attacks during the execution of `claimCvgSdtRewards()`, resulting in potential financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement slippage protection at the outer layer of the function
