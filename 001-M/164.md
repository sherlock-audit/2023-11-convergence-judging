# Incorrect slippage used for swapping `SDT` to `CvgSdt` tokens while claiming rewards

## Summary

The logic for claiming `CVG` and `SDT` rewards through the [`claimCvgSdtRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L396-L402) function in the `SdtStakingPositionService` contract allows specifying whether the claimed `SDT` tokens should be converted to `CrvSDT` tokens. The `claimCvgSdtRewards` function calls the `SdtRewardReceiver`'s [`claimCvgSdtSimple`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L399) function, where the conversion of `SDT` to `CrvSDT` tokens can be achieved either through [minting at a 1:1 ratio](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtRewardReceiver.sol#L231) or by using the [Curve pool to exchange](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtRewardReceiver.sol#L233-L235) the `SDT` rewards for `CrvSDT` token

The swapping mechanism should only work if the returned amount in `CvgSDT` tokens is greater than the amount of rewards in `SDT`. This is also indicated in [the comment in source code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtRewardReceiver.sol#L234). 

## Vulnerability Detail

The pool's `exchange` function, used to calculate slippage as an expected value, relies on the result of the [`get_dy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtRewardReceiver.sol#L235) function, which returns the amount of tokens that would be obtained for the given input token amount.

```solidity
(..)
    ICrvPoolPlain _poolCvgSDT = poolCvgSDT;
    /// @dev Only swap if the returned amount in CvgSdt is gretear than the amount rewarded in SDT
    _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, _poolCvgSDT.get_dy(0, 1, rewardAmount), receiver);
(..)
```

This means that the functionality does not work as expected and will perform swaps at the current rate, without any slippage protection, even in cases where the resulting amount of `CvgSDT` tokens is smaller than the input amount of `SDT` tokens.

## Impact

The use of swapping `SDT` tokens to `CvgSDT` while claiming rewards is vulnerable to multiple exploitation scenarios:
- An attacker might execute a sandwich attack against the user claiming rewards, as there is no slippage protection in place.
- Users might lose portions of `SDT` tokens when swapping for `CvgSDT` since the exchange will be done at the current rate, even if it is highly unfavorable for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use the `expected` parameter with the value of `rewardAmount`, which will correctly implement the intended logic. The swap will only succeed in cases where the amount of received `CvgSDT` is greater than the amount of rewarded `SDT` tokens.

```solidity
 _poolCvgSDT.exchange(0, 1, rewardAmount, rewardAmount, receiver);
```
