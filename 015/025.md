# Unsafe usage of transfer and transferFrom

## Summary

Using unsafe ERC20 methods without checking their results can silently fail transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are many [Weird ERC20 Tokens](https://www.hacknote.co/17c261f7d8fWbdml/doc/182a568ab5cUOpDM) that won't work correctly using the standard IERC20 interface.

## Impact

ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of `transfer` and `transferFrom` could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. It is safer to wrap such calls into `require()` statements to these failures.

## Recommendation

**Recommendation: Utilize OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 Library**

To address these vulnerabilities, it is highly recommended to integrate OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` library into the smart contract. This library provides `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions designed to handle return value checks and accommodate tokens deviating from standard `ERC-20` specifications.

Incorporating `SafeERC20` reinforces the reliability of `ERC-20` interactions within your smart contract, ensuring seamless compatibility with both compliant and non-compliant tokens. This proactive measure enhances the security and functionality of your protocol, minimizing the risk of transaction reverting due to inadequately handled return values.
