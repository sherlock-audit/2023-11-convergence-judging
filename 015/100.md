# Use safeTransferFrom always

## Summary
It is advisable to incorporate a statement that validates the return value of token transfers. Alternatively, using mechanisms like OpenZeppelin's safeTransfer or safeTransferFrom is recommended, unless there is certainty that the involved token would revert in case of a transfer failure. Failing to implement such precautions may lead to inconspicuous transfer failures, impacting token accounting within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability may result in mismanagement of token transfers, affecting the intended minting functionality. Silent failures could lead to incorrect balances and potentially disrupt the expected behavior of the contract, impacting its overall functionality and reliability.
