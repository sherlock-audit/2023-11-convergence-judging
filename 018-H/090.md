# stdBuffer:155 does not transfer the bribe token as documented

## Summary
stdBuffer:155 does not transfer the bribe token as documented

## Vulnerability Detail
This is an issue that std::Buffer does not transfer the bribe token out as documented:
```solidity
...
        /// @dev Iterates through bribes assets, transfers them to the staking and push in the TokenReward amount
        for (uint256 j; j < bribeTokens.length; ) {
            IERC20 token = bribeTokens[j].token;
            uint256 amount = bribeTokens[j].amount;
            /// @dev Fetches the bribe token balance
            if (amount != 0) {
                /// @dev Pushes in the TokenAmount array
                tokenAmounts[counter++] = ICommonStruct.TokenAmount({token: token, amount: amount});
            }
```

## Impact
bribe tokens get stuck in StdBuffer and the stakers cannot accrue bribe tokens timely after the end of each cycle.

## Recommendation
```solidity
...
        /// @dev Iterates through bribes assets, transfers them to the staking and push in the TokenReward amount
        for (uint256 j; j < bribeTokens.length; ) {
            IERC20 token = bribeTokens[j].token;
            uint256 amount = bribeTokens[j].amount;
+           token.transfer(sdtRewardsReceiver, amount);
            /// @dev Fetches the bribe token balance
            if (amount != 0) {
                /// @dev Pushes in the TokenAmount array
                tokenAmounts[counter++] = ICommonStruct.TokenAmount({token: token, amount: amount});
            }
```
