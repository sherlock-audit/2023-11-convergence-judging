# Multiple deposits of the same token in one TDE may result in locked tokens

## Summary

If multiple deposits are made within the same TDE cycle with `depositMultipleToken`, and a claim is executed after one but before another, then the following claim will revert for the tokenId since each tokenId can only make one claim per TDE cycle.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `depositMultipleToken`, we increment the amount for the TDE and the given reward token with the following line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L114
```solidity
// depositMultipleToken
depositedTokenAmountForTde[_actualTDE][_token] += _amount;
```

Since we're incrementing here, it implies that multiple deposits should be able to be processed per TDE. The problem is that if someone claims between deposits in a TDE, they will not be able to also claim for following deposits in that TDE. This is the case because when rewards a claimed for a tokenId, that token is marked as unable to claim for the given TDE again:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L179
```solidity
// claimRewards()
require(!rewardsClaimedForToken[tokenId][tdeId], "ALREADY_CLAIMED");
...
rewardsClaimedForToken[tokenId][tdeId] = true;
```

In the case that this happens, the unclaimable tokens will be permanently locked in the contract since there's no other withdrawal mechanism.

## Impact

Tokens may be permanently locked in the contract.

## Recommendation

Revert in `depositMultipleToken` if a deposit has already been made for the given tokenId.
