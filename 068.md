# Transfers of ERC721 lead to fund stuck or loss

## Summary
Both [position manger contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionManager.sol) are essentially ERC721, which is eligible for token transferring. Under certain conditions, transfer would cause user to lose tokens or fund to be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
Say Bob deposits some staked token to the position service, and is minted a position by the position manager. Then Bob decides to sell the token to Alice at a lower price. Alice purchased the position, but Bob claimed his reward before token's transfer transaction, Bob will get his reward and staked assets back, while Alice, the deserved buyer will not get anything.

## Impact
As explained above, if the NFT gets transferred, new owner may not be able to get deserved tokens.

## Recommendation
Disable position transfer is token transfer is not intended, else consider disabling token transfer once reward is claimed.
