# Malicous seller can abuse `increaseLockTimeAndAmount` that leads to DOS prventing buyers from claiming `ysCVG` rewards

## Summary

After minting a position, users have the ability to increase the locked amount of their position, on each `increaseLockTimeAndAmount` call a lock extension element is pushed to the locking extensions of that token. These extensions are later looped over when claiming `ysCVG` rewards. As known, minted tokens are sellable, a user can mess up that token's extensions making the ysCVG rewards unclaimable for the buyers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LockingPositionService` contract keeps the history of the different extensions that are applied on an open position/NFT, this is being tracked using the `lockExtensions` array. However, this array has no limit so it can be filled up with extensions, which cause any transaction that loops over it to revert, due to a gas outage.

A user can fill `lockExtensions` up by continuously calling `increaseLockTimeAndAmount` and passing the following parameters:
* `tokenId`: user's token Id
* `durationAdd`: 0
* `amount`: 1wei
* `operator`: token's owner

A sample scenario:
1. User 1 opens a lock position using 1cvg for 12 cycles, with `100` as the `ysPercentage` (this is important)
2. User 1 calls `increaseLockTimeAndAmount` a lot of times, while passing a dust amount, and 0 as the `durationAdd`
3. The token's extensions array is now filled and looping over it will cause the transaction to revert because the gas limit has been reached
4. User 1 locks the token, so he can put it up for sale
5. User 1 sells the token to User 2, on the basis that there are rewards associated with it, that can be claimed
6. User 2 calls the `claimRewards` function in the `YsDistributor` contract and the transaction reverts, because `balanceOfYsCvgAt` is called which is looping over the extensions array

## Impact

Prevent users from claiming `ysCVG` rewards.
