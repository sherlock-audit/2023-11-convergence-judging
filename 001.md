# uninitialized local

## Summary
Uninitialized local variable

## Vulnerability Detail
LockingPositionDelegate.getMgDelegateeInfoPerTokenAndAddress(uint256,address)._toPercentage,  is a local variable never initialized
## Impact
using uninitialized variables can result in unpredictable and inconsistent behavior of the smart contract. This can make it difficult for developers to reason about the code and may lead to unexpected outcomes.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize all the variables. If a variable is meant to be initialized to zero, explicitly set it to zero to improve code readability.
