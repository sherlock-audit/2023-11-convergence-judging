# A user which is the only $CVG locker for YS during a TDE, can steal rewards from other TDEs

## Summary
Due to different formulas used when checkpointing and calculating balance of YS shares, some users may be able to claim more rewards than due if they are the only users to have allocated tokens to YS during a TDE

## Vulnerability Detail

### Context
To keep track of the total supply of YS shares at any given cycle, Convergence uses an incremental approach, where only supply differences are recorded into variables:

If a user has minted a new locking position and is about to receive `ysTotalAmount`:
`LockingPositionService.sol::_ysCvgCheckpoint`:
```solidity
    totalSuppliesTracking[realStartCycle].ysToAdd += ysTotalAmount;
    totalSuppliesTracking[realEndCycle].ysToSub += ysTotalAmount;
```

This enables to update the total supply efficiently at each cycle by calling `LockingPositionService::updateYsTotalSupply` and using the formula:
```solidity
/** @dev Register the last totalSupply for the past cycle. */
totalSupplyYsCvgHistories[actualCycle - 1] = totalSupplyYsCvgBeforeUpdate;

/** @dev Update ysCVG  total supply with checkpoints for the actual cycle */
totalSupplyYsCvg =
    totalSupplyYsCvgBeforeUpdate +
    totalSuppliesTracking[actualCycle].ysToAdd -
    totalSuppliesTracking[actualCycle].ysToSub;
```

### Bug description
However due to a slightly different formula used for share calculation during the creation of the position and claiming, the amount used as total supply can be slightly below the sum of individual user balances (by a few wei).

For reference the two different calculations below, `_ysCvgCheckpoint` and `balanceOfYsCvgAt` respectively: 

`LockingPositionService::_ysCvgCheckpoint`:
```solidity
uint256 ysTotalAmount = (lockDuration * cvgLockAmount) / MAX_LOCK;       
```
Which is equivalent to:
```solidity
uint256 ysTotalAmount = (lockDuration * ((amount * ysPercentage) / MAX_PERCENTAGE)) / MAX_LOCK;       
```

Whereas `LockingPositionService::balanceOfYsCvgAt`:

```solidity
uint256 _ysTotal = (((_extension.endCycle - _extension.cycleId) *
    _extension.cvgLocked *
    _lockingPosition.ysPercentage) / MAX_PERCENTAGE) / MAX_LOCK;
```
Which is equivalent to:
```solidity
uint256 ysTotalAmount = ((lockDuration * amount * ysPercentage) / MAX_PERCENTAGE) / MAX_LOCK;       
```

Notice how the parentheses are not equivalent, which means that one formula rounds more than the other.

We can see for example:
lockDuration: 64
amount: 15
ysPercentage: 10

in the first case:
`ysTotalAmount1 = 0` -> used for totalSupply update

in the second case:
`ysTotalAmount2 = 1` -> used for balance computation, claiming

### Scenario
Alice is the only user allocating YS for a given TDE.

current cycle = N
-> Alice locks some small amount for `lockDuration = 64` so that it increases totalSupply by exactly 1
-> Alice proceeds to lock X times using the values: 
>    lockDuration: 64
>    amount: 15
>    ysPercentage: 10

If during any TDEs included in the interval [N, N+64], Alice is the only user having allocated to YS, Alice can claim X times the rewards accumulated during that TDE.

## Impact
Under specific circumstances (if the attacker is the only one to have allocated to YS during a TDE), an attacker is able to claim arbitrarily more rewards than is due to him, stealing rewards from other participants in the protocol.

Foundry Fuzzing

## Recommendation
Use the exact same formula in both cases to compute `ysTotalAmount`
