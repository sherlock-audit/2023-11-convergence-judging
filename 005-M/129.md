# SdtStakingPositionService::_claimCvgSdtRewards is prone to OOG if rewards are claimed after a long unclaimed period

## Summary

If rewards have never been claimed for a tokenID, `SdtStakingPositionService::_claimCvgSdtRewards` iterates over all cycles since position has been created. This means that a user who has never claimed rewards for a long dated position risks of having all of her rewards locked permanently due to a Out of gas error.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises in the `_claimCvgSdtRewards` function, in the `for` loop:

```solidity
    for (; lastClaimedSdt < actualCycle; ) {
    ...
    }
```

Users who don't claim their rewards for prolonged periods will face a scenario where the `for` loop requires iterations beyond the gas limit, causing an out-of-gas error (OOG).

Scenario:

1. Bob stakes his assets but doesn't claim his rewards for several cycles.
2. After many cycles, Bob decides to claim his accumulated rewards.
3. Bob triggers the `_claimCvgSdtRewards` function, expecting to receive a large sum of SDT rewards.
4. `_claimCvgSdtRewards` iterates over an a large number of cycles and the transaction fails from an OOG error.
5. Bob loses all of his accumulated rewards which are now unclaimable.

## Impact

This issue will prevent users from claiming their rewards when `currentCycle - lastClaimedSdt` becomes excessively large. This will render the rewards unclaimable, causing loss of rewards.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Implement a claim-by-cycle approach. Instead of claiming rewards for all cycles in one transaction, users can claim their rewards up to a given cycle (which can be current cycle by default)
