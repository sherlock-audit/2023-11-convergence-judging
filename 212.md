# a malicious user can prevent a user from  receiving a delegation

## Summary
the logic that is used to control the amount  of time a user can receive  a delegation  can be to grief the receiver of the delegation  
## Vulnerability Detail
in **lockingPositiodelegate** there is a variable called  **maxTokenIdsDelegated**  which is used to control the amount  of time a user can receive  a delegation and   a malicious user can use this to grief by locking a small amount of tokens then mint an ERC721 token  and delegate to the user address with a very small percentage so  that when  another user    want to delegate with more percentages he will not be  able because of  **maxTokenIdsDelegated**
## Impact
a malicious user can prevent another user from receiving a  delegation

## Recommendation
add a  function in which  a delegation  account can remove the number of delegated accounts or add a minimum of percentage that a user can delegate
