# Possible to remove all gauges by providing only one address (gauge)

## Summary
Due to the wrong index manipulation in the `removeGauge` function it is possible to remove all gauges by providing the address that has been removed before
## Vulnerability Detail
For the sake of simplicity let's imagine that we have an array of addresses called gauges where  `gauges = [0x1, 0x2, 0x3]` and we have a mapping of `address => uint256` to track the ids of the gauges in the array. Also we used a function called `addGauge(address gaugeAddress)` to add these gauges https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/CvgRewards.sol#L129-L133

This means that our map (gaugesId) is equal to `(0x1=0, 0x2=1, 0x3=2)`. Now, when removing a gauge with the specific address (let's say 0x1) we call the "removeGauge" function. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/CvgRewards.sol#L139-L154

After the function above is executed our gauges will be `[0x3, 0x2]` however our gaugesID map will be `(0x1=0, 0x2=1, 0x3=0)`. If there is a subsequent call to `removeGauge` with the same address that has been removed (0x1) it will cause the removal of the 0x3 since it is on the first place (id=0) of gauges array (the idGaugeToRemove will be 0). 

This may lead to the accidental deletion of a wrong gauge. 

## Impact
This could result in the inadvertent removal of an incorrect gauge when the same address is mistakenly provided twice.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either check if the address exists in the gauges array before removing it (CvgRewards.sol) or assert the same thing in the GaugeController.vy (same like for adding the same gauge twice). 
Another solution would be to handle the indices differently (starting with 1 instead of 0 and only assign 0 to the deleted ones).
