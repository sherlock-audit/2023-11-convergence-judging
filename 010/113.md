# `removeGauge()` function logic error

## Summary
If you delete the same address multiple times or delete an address that does not exist, the wrong address will be deleted.
## Vulnerability Detail

Since the data type of gaugesId is a mapping. When an address that does not exist is entered, the returned idGaugeToRemove is 0, which is consistent with the parameter returned by the first address of gaugesId.

Here is an example to explain what happens when the same address is deleted and the address no longer exists.

```solidity
1.
addGauge(0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138)
addGauge(0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4)
addGauge(0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2)
addGauge(0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db)
addGauge(0x78731D3Ca6b7E34aC0F824c42a7cC18A495cabaB)

gaugesId is as follows:
// 0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138
// 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4
// 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2
// 0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db
// 0x78731D3Ca6b7E34aC0F824c42a7cC18A495cabaB


2.removeGauge(0x78731D3Ca6b7E34aC0F824c42a7cC18A495cabaB)
gaugesId is as follows:
// 0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138
// 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4
// 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2
// 0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db


3.removeGauge(0x78731D3Ca6b7E34aC0F824c42a7cC18A495cabaB)
gaugesId is as follows:
// 0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db
// 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4
// 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2

```
Judging from the above example, when the same address is deleted repeatedly, or a non-existent address is deleted, the first address of gaugesid will be deleted.

```solidity
     function addGauge(address gaugeAddress) external {
         require(address(cvgControlTower.gaugeController()) == msg.sender, "NOT_GAUGE_CONTROLLER");
         gauges.push(gaugeAddress);
         gaugesId[gaugeAddress] = gauges.length - 1;
     }

     /**
      * @notice Remove a gauge from the array, replace it by the last gauge of the array
      * @param gaugeAddress gaugeAddress to remove
      */
     function removeGauge(address gaugeAddress) external {
         require(address(cvgControlTower.gaugeController()) == msg.sender, "NOT_GAUGE_CONTROLLER");
         uint256 idGaugeToRemove = gaugesId[gaugeAddress];
         address lastGauge = gauges[gauges.length - 1];

         /// @dev replace id of last gauge by deleted one
         gaugesId[lastGauge] = idGaugeToRemove;
         /// @dev Set ID of gauge as 0
         gaugesId[gaugeAddress] = 0;

         /// @dev moove last gauge address to the id of the deleted one
         gauges[idGaugeToRemove] = lastGauge;

         /// @dev remove last array element
         gauges.pop();
     }
```

## Recommendation

It is recommended that before calling the removeGauge function, you can check externally to ensure that the gauge address to be deleted is not repeated. This can be achieved using the set library
