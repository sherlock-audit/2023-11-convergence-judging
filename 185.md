# Use safeTransfer instead of transfer

## Summary

There are several cases where `transfer` is used incorrectly, and `safeTransfer` should be used instead. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There are a few cases where we should be using safeTransfer instead of transfer. 

For example, in `stdBuffer.sol`, we have the following lines in `pullRewards` to transfer reward tokens to the correct party:

`token.transfer(address(_feeCollector), sdtFees);`
`token.transfer(_processor, claimerRewards);`
`token.transfer(sdtRewardsReceiver, balance);`

All of these use IERC20 transfer method, which looks like this:

`function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);`

However, tokens like USDT (which I confirmed with the sponsor could be a reward token) have a different function signature, and so this call will revert. This means that if USDT is a reward token for the staking service, we won't be able to pull rewards. 

## Impact

`processSdtRewards` will revert, meaning that rewards cannot be pulled
