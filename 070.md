# Fee on transfer tokens can lead to incorrect mint

## Summary

There are ERC20 tokens that charge fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the token being used in this function is USDT (Tether) or any other token with a fee-on-transfer mechanism, the behavior can be influenced by the token's specific implementation. Fee-on-transfer mechanisms are often used to charge a fee on each token transfer, and they can affect the amount received by the recipient.

## Impact

The `transferFrom` function is used to transfer `amount` tokens from the caller (`msg.sender`) to `cvgControlTower.veSdtMultisig()`. However, depending on the specific implementation of the token (USDT in this case), the fee-on-transfer mechanism may deduct a percentage of the transferred amount as a fee.

Here are some potential scenarios:

1. **Fee Deduction during Transfer:** If USDT has a fee-on-transfer mechanism, the `transferFrom` operation might result in a deduction of a certain percentage of the transferred amount as a fee. This means that the actual amount received by `cvgControlTower.veSdtMultisig()` could be less than the specified `amount`.

2. **Minting without Deducting Fee:** The `_mint` function is then called to mint new tokens and assign them to the specified `account`. This minting operation might not be subject to the fee-on-transfer mechanism, and the full `amount` of tokens could be minted and assigned to the `account`.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external {
    sdt.transferFrom(msg.sender, cvgControlTower.veSdtMultisig(), amount);
    _mint(account, amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to find the balance of the current contract before and after the `transferFrom` to see how much tokens were received, and mint only what was received.
