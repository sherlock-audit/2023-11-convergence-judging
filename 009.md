# Removing gauges during reward distribution may lead to DoS

## Summary
Removing gauges during reward distribution may lead to DoS due to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
All functions within `writeStakingRewards` keep a cursor to now up to which gauge have they checkpointed thus far (in case there are too many gauges). However, as gauges can be removed while checkpoints are happening, this could allow for a situation where `cursor > _endChunk`  This would mean that the call to `_getGaugeChunk(cursor, _endChunk)` will revert due to the following line of code:
```solidity
    function _getGaugeChunk(uint256 from, uint256 to) internal view returns (address[] memory) {
        address[] memory chunk = new address[](to - from);
```
All of the 4 functions within `writeStakingRewards` have this exact functionality. If this happens within either of them, it will cause DoS within the contract. 
```solidity
    function _checkpoints() internal {
        require(lastUpdatedTimestamp + 7 days <= block.timestamp, "NEED_WAIT_7_DAYS");

        ICvgControlTower _cvgControlTower = cvgControlTower;
        IGaugeController _gaugeController = _cvgControlTower.gaugeController();
        uint128 _cursor = cursor;
        uint128 _totalGaugeNumber = uint128(gauges.length);

        /// @dev if first chunk, to don't break gauges votes if someone votes between 2 writeStakingRewards chunks we need to lock the gauge votes on GaugeController
        if (_cursor == 0) {
            /// @dev Lock votes
            _gaugeController.set_lock(true);
        }

        /// @dev compute the theoretical end of the chunk
        uint128 _maxEnd = _cursor + cvgRewardsConfig.maxChunkCheckpoint;
        /// @dev compute the real end of the chunk regarding the length of the tAssetArray
        uint128 _endChunk = _maxEnd < _totalGaugeNumber ? _maxEnd : _totalGaugeNumber;

        /// @dev if last chunk of the checkpoint process
        if (_endChunk == _totalGaugeNumber) {
            /// @dev reset the cursor to 0 for _setTotalWeight
            cursor = 0;
            /// @dev set the step as LOCK_TOTAL_WEIGHT for reward distribution
            state = State.LOCK_TOTAL_WEIGHT;
        } else {
            /// @dev setup the cursor at the index start for the next chunk
            cursor = _endChunk;
        }

        /// @dev updates the weight of the chunked gauges
        _gaugeController.gauge_relative_weight_writes(_getGaugeChunk(_cursor, _endChunk));

        /// @dev emit the event only at the last chunk
        if (_endChunk == _totalGaugeNumber) {
            emit Checkpoints(_cvgControlTower.cvgCycle());
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
add check if `cursor > _endChunk`  `cursor = _endChunk`
