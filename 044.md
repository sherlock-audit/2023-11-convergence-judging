# SdtBuffer, CvgSdtBuffer transfer ownership to potentially 0 address

## Summary
`SdtBuffer`,` CvgSdtBuffer` transfer ownership to potentially 0 address

## Vulnerability Detail

`SdtBuffer` and `CvgSdtBuffer` calls `_transferOwnership(_cvgControlTower.treasuryDao())`.

However `_cvgControlTower.treasuryDao()` may return 0 address if `treasuryDao` was set to 0 address.

This will result in loss of owneship of the contract

## Impact

Loss of ownership, cannot call `setProcessorRewardsPercentage`

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check `treasuryDao` is not 0 address

```solidity
        address treasuryDao = _cvgControlTower.treasuryDao();
        require(treasuryDao != address(0));
        _transferOwnership(treasuryDao);
```
