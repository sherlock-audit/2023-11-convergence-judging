# unchecked-transfer

## Summary
The return value of an external transfer/transferFrom call is not checked
## Vulnerability Detail
CvgSDT.mint(address,uint256) ignores return value by sdt.transferFrom(msg.sender,cvgControlTower.veSdtMultisig(),amount)
## Impact
If the transferFrom call fails, but the mint function continues without checking the return value, it might result in a successful transaction from the contract's perspective. However, the overall transaction may be reverted when miners process it, causing confusion and potential issues for users.
If the transferFrom function fails (e.g., due to insufficient allowance or other conditions), and the return value is not checked, the mint function may proceed as if the transfer was successful. This could result in a loss of funds for the user or unexpected behavior.
An unchecked transfer could potentially lead to unauthorized minting or other malicious activities.
