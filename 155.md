# Readonly-reentrancy vulnerability can allow malicious contracts to manipulate state variables in `YsDistributor` contract

## Summary
The code snippet is a function that calculates the token reward amount for a given token, TDE, and share. The function reads a state variable that was written after an external call. This can allow malicious contracts to manipulate the state variable and affect the function logic.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `getTokenRewardAmountForTde()` reads a state variable `depositedTokenAmountForTde` at line 335. This variable is a mapping that stores the total amount of tokens deposited for each TDE and token. The function reads the value of this variable and multiplies it by the share to calculate the token reward amount. However, this variable was written after an external call at line 114. The external call is to `safeTransferFrom()` on the token contract, which can be a malicious contract that re-enters the `YsDistributor` contract and changes the value of `depositedTokenAmountForTde`. This can allow the malicious contract to manipulate the state variable and affect the function logic.

## Impact
Readonly-reentrancy vulnerability can have serious consequences for the functionality and security of the contract. For example, if a malicious contract can change the value of `depositedTokenAmountForTde`, it can affect the token reward amount calculation and cause the function to return an incorrect or zero value. This can result in a loss of funds for the user or the processor. Moreover, the malicious contract can also exploit the contract logic and bypass some checks or validations.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent readonly-reentrancy vulnerability, avoid reading state variables that were written after external calls. Use local variables or parameters to store the values before the external calls. Alternatively, you can also use a reentrancy guard modifier, such as OpenZeppelin, to prevent re-entrancy. 
```diff
function getTokenRewardAmountForTde(IERC20 _token, uint256 _tdeId, uint256 _share) public view returns (uint256) {
         // Vulnerable line: reading state variable that was written after external call
-        return (depositedTokenAmountForTde[_tdeId][_token] * _share) / 10 ** 20;
       // Fixed line: using local variable to store the value before external call
+        uint256 depositedAmount = depositedTokenAmountForTde[_tdeId][_token];
+        return (depositedAmount * _share) / 10 ** 20;
    }
