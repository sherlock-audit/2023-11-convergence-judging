# Incorrect comparison in the `areLimitsVerified` calculation in the CvgOracle contract.

## Summary

Incorrect comparison in the `areLimitsVerified` calculation in the CvgOracle contract.

## Vulnerability Detail


In the CvgOracle contract, there is a calculation for the `areLimitsVerified` variable:

```solidity
areLimitsVerified = limitPrice > oracleParams.minPrice && limitPrice > oracleParams.maxPrice;
```
This calculation compares the `limitPrice` with `minPrice` and `maxPrice`. However, it should be comparing the `limitPrice` with `minPrice` using the less than (<) operator, not the greater than (>) operator.

## Impact

The incorrect comparison in the `areLimitsVerified` calculation may lead to incorrect evaluation of the limits. This can result in unexpected behavior or incorrect validation of price limits.



## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Oracles/CvgOracle.sol#L96
```solidity
areLimitsVerified = limitPrice > oracleParams.minPrice && limitPrice < oracleParams.maxPrice;

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to modify the calculation of `areLimitsVerified` as shown in the code snippet above. This ensures that the `limitPrice` is compared correctly with both the minimum and maximum price limits. It is also advisable to thoroughly test the contract after making the recommended change to ensure its correctness and proper functionality.

```solidity
areLimitsVerified = limitPrice > oracleParams.minPrice && limitPrice < oracleParams.maxPrice;

```
