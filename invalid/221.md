# wrong calculation which  leads to a not being able to function properly

## Summary
 wrong maths leads to revert 
## Vulnerability Detail
in the function **_ysCvgCheckpoint**  if the actualCycle is not divisible by 12  it will run some additional codes  and line 592 might revert in some case for example lets say actualCycle  is 1  since 1 is not divisble be 12 it will go into the if statement   and line 592 will be run
which is 
`            uint256 nextTdeCycle = (actualCycle / TDE_DURATION + 1) * TDE_DURATION + 1;
`
nextdeCycle  will be zero because  (1/13)* 13 is zero
and in the next line 
`            uint256 ysNextTdeAmount = ((nextTdeCycle - realStartCycle) * ysTotalAmount) / TDE_DURATION;
`
 it will do some calculation  in our case **nextTdeCycle** is zero and it will try to subtract from zero which will cause an error and will revert since the actualCycle starts from 1  if the user have percentage to lock  yscvg   it will revert 
## Impact
 sc not being able to lock propely
