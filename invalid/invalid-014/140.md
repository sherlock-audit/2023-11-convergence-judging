# Ignoring return value of `transfer()` can lead to silent failures in `withdraw()` function

## Summary
The code snippet is a function that withdraws tokens from the contract and transfers them to the receiver. The function ignores the return value of `transfer()` when transferring tokens from the staking asset to the receiver. This can lead to silent failures if the transfer fails for any reason.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `withdraw()` calls `transfer()` without checking the return value. According to the ERC20 specification, `transfer()` should return a `boolean` value indicating whether the transfer was successful or not. If the transfer fails, the function should revert or handle the error. However, the function does not check the return value and assumes that the transfer always succeeds. This can lead to silent failures if the transfer fails for any reason, such as insufficient balance, a revert in the token contract, or a non-compliant token implementation.

## Impact
A silent failure can have serious consequences for the functionality and security of the contract. For example, if the transfer fails, then the receiver will not receive the expected amount of tokens. Moreover, the function will not update the state of the contract, such as the balance or the allowance, which can affect the accounting and logic of the contract.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid silent failures, check the return value of `transfer()` and revert or handle the error if the transfer fails. You can use `require()` to check the return value and revert with a message if the transfer fails.
```diff
function withdraw(address receiver, uint256 amount) external {
        require(cvgControlTower.isSdtStaking(msg.sender), "ONLY_SD_ASSET_STAKING");
        /// @dev Fetch the gaugeAsset on the associated Staking contract +  Tranfer the ERC20 token to the receiver
         // Vulnerable line: ignoring return value of transfer
-        ISdtStakingPositionService(msg.sender).stakingAsset().transfer(receiver, amount);
        // Fixed line: checking return value of transfer
+        require(ISdtStakingPositionService(msg.sender).stakingAsset().transfer(receiver, amount), "Transfer failed");
    }
