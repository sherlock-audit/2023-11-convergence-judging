# Risks of frontrunning due to unsafe approval processes

## Summary

Smart contract approval vulnerabilities discussed highlight the potential risks associated with unlimited approvals and approval frontrunning.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability of approval frontrunning arises from the inherent timing dynamics of multiple approve calls. When a user initiates an approve request to modify the allowance after an initial approval, a window of opportunity is unintentionally created. Malicious actors can exploit this window by executing the `transferFrom` function before the user's transaction is included in the blockchain. 

## Impact

Scenario:
Attackers monitor the blockchain for pending transactions, particularly those involving approval calls. By strategically placing their transactions before a user's intended approval modification, they can front-run and execute unauthorized transfers, moving additional tokens than intended by the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, developers are advised to avoid requiring unlimited approvals and instead implement an allowance system that limits approvals to the necessary amount. Utilizing functions like `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` from OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 implementation can help prevent frontrunning attacks.
