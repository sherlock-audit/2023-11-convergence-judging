# Reentrancy while claiming rewards

## Summary

The [`claimRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L155-L195) function of the `YsDistributor` contract enables users to claim associated rewards. The function triggers the internal [`_claimTokenRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L205-L223), which executes transfers using [`safeTransfer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L215) wrapper. Once completed, the claim is marked as already executed by updating the [`rewardsClaimedForToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L194) storage variable.

The issue is that this logic is vulnerable to reentrancy attack. If an external call can hijack execution during the transfer operation, an attacker can reenter the `claimRewards` function, draining all funds from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [rewards are marked as claimed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L194) after the external call, which can occur during [the transfer of tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/YsDistributor.sol#L215) within the `_claimTokenRewards` function. An attacker capable of hijacking the execution of the claim token rewards process during token transfer can potentially drain the entire balance of the contract.

## Impact

Exploiting this vulnerability requires integrating a token that allows hijacking the execution. While this is a common mechanism for ERC-777 standard tokens with hooks, it is not limited to those and may be applicable to other tokens as well.

Handling this issue would require protocol owners to conduct audits on every token added to the `YsDistributor` to ensure that it is not susceptible to execution hijacking during token transfers. Failure to do so would result in a critical severity issue, leading to the loss of all funds from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update the value in `rewardsClaimedForToken` mapping before executing the internal function `_claimTokenRewards`:
```solidity
/// @dev Mark the TDE id for this token as claimed on the Storage.
rewardsClaimedForToken[tokenId][tdeId] = true;

/// @dev Claim according token rewards.
_claimTokenRewards(tokenId, tdeId, share, receiver);
```
