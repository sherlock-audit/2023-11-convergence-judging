# CvgRewards - Can add duplicate gauge and remove non-existing gauge

## Summary
`CvgRewards` - Can add duplicate gauge and remove non-existing gauge

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions `addGauge` and `removeGauge` lacks check on existence of gauge. This leads to caller being able to add duplicate gauge addresses and removing non-existing gauges.

Check is handled by `GaugeController.vy`. However it is recommended to not assume that this will always be true.

## Impact
#### Removal of undesired gauge address.

For example, the following will remove `address(1)`

```solidity
addGauge(address(1));
removeGauge(address(2));
```
 
#### Gauge addresses and ids out of sync

The following example will map both `address(1)` and `address(2)` to ID 0

```solidity
        addGauge(address(1));
        addGauge(address(2));
        addGauge(address(2));
        removeGauge(address(2));
        console.log("GAUGE ID", gaugesId[address(1)]);
        console.log("GAUGE ID", gaugesId[address(2)]);
        console.log("GAUGE ADDR", gauges[0]);
        console.log("GAUGE ADDR", gauges[1]);
```

```shell
  GAUGE ID 0
  GAUGE ID 0
  GAUGE ADDR 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001
  GAUGE ADDR 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002
```

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add proper checks inside `CvgRewards.sol`

```solidity
    mapping(address => bool) public isGauge;

    /**
     *  @notice Add a gauge in the gauge list
     *  @param gaugeAddress gaugeAddress to add
     */
    function addGauge(address gaugeAddress) external {
        require(address(cvgControlTower.gaugeController()) == msg.sender, "NOT_GAUGE_CONTROLLER");
        require(!isGauge[gaugeAddress]);
        isGauge[gaugeAddress] = true;
        gauges.push(gaugeAddress);
        gaugesId[gaugeAddress] = gauges.length - 1;
    }

    /**
     *  @notice Remove a gauge from the array, replace it by the last gauge of the array
     *  @param gaugeAddress gaugeAddress to remove
     */
    function removeGauge(address gaugeAddress) external {
        require(address(cvgControlTower.gaugeController()) == msg.sender, "NOT_GAUGE_CONTROLLER");
        require(isGauge[gaugeAddress]);
        isGauge[gaugeAddress] = false;
        
        uint256 idGaugeToRemove = gaugesId[gaugeAddress];
        address lastGauge = gauges[gauges.length - 1];

        /// @dev replace id of last gauge by deleted one
        gaugesId[lastGauge] = idGaugeToRemove;
        /// @dev Set ID of gauge as 0
        gaugesId[gaugeAddress] = 0;

        /// @dev moove last gauge address to the id of the deleted one
        gauges[idGaugeToRemove] = lastGauge;

        /// @dev remove last array element
        gauges.pop();
    }

```
