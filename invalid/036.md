# Potential Security Vulnerability in onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract Modifier of LockingPositionService Contract due to tx.origin Usage

## Summary

The use of `tx.origin` in `LockingPositionService` allows any caller, including potential malicious actors. To enhance security, it is recommended to replace `tx.origin` with `msg.sender`, as the latter provides the direct caller's address. While `tx.origin` may be semi-legitimized for tracking contract interactions, its use is discouraged due to security risks. Additionally, using `tx.origin` for blocking specific addresses can be addressed through alternative means. It's crucial to note that the use of `tx.origin` is deprecated and should be avoided.

## Vulnerability Detail

Insecure usage of `tx.origin` in `LockingPositionService` contract's `onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract` modifier may expose security vulnerabilities, allowing potential manipulation by malicious actors.

## Impact

**MEDIUM**

The vulnerability in the `onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract` modifier of the `LockingPositionService` contract using `tx.origin` can lead to unauthorized access, compromising the security of the contract.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/e894be3e36614a385cf409dc7e278d5b8f16d6f2/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Locking/LockingPositionService.sol#L184

```solidity
function _onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract() internal view {
    require(
        msg.sender == tx.origin || isContractLocker[msg.sender],
        "NOT_CONTRACT_OR_WL"
    );
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove `msg.sender == tx.origin` from the require check in `_onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract`. The updated code ensures that the function and modifier solely rely on `msg.sender` for enhanced security:

```solidity
function _onlyWalletOrWhiteListedContract() internal view {
    require(
        isContractLocker[msg.sender],
        "NOT_CONTRACT_OR_WL"
    );
}
```
