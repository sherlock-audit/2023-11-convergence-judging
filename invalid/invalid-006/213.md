# Did not approve to zero first issue

## Summary

Some tokens like USDT do not allow approve to be called on a non-zero allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to README

> Receives rewards from the treasury. The list of ERC20 can vary.

> Curve (CRV)
> Convex (CVX)
> StakeDao (SDT)
> Frax-Share (FXS)
> Prisma (PRISMA)
> USDC
> USDT
> DAI

also

> Are there any FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens interacting with the smart contracts?

> We have some interaction with USDC and potentially USDT.

and the last,

> Do you expect to use any of the following tokens with non-standard behaviour with the smart contracts?

> USDC & USDT

Clearly, the USDT is expected to be used in Convergence.

As we can check on-chain of USDT contract [code](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)

```solidity
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {

        // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
        //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
        //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
        //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
        require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));

        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    }
```

So, seeing this following snippet, it's a well understand that this approval will be reverted because of the approve should set to zero first

```solidity
File: SdtUtilities.sol
215:         for (uint256 i; i < _tokenSpenders.length; ) {
216:             IERC20(_tokenSpenders[i].token).approve(_tokenSpenders[i].spender, _tokenSpenders[i].amount);
217:             unchecked {
218:                 ++i;
219:             }
220:         }
```

## Impact

Approval of USDT token will fail

## Recommendation

Recommend setting allowance to zero first before setting it to a non zero value.
