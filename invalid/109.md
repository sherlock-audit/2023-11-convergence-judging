# Lock time extension indefinitely increases voting power at no extra cost

## Summary
Stakers have the option to repeatedly extend their CVG token lock beyond the initial 96 cycles (672 days), maintaining their voting power without the need for extra CVG tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract design permits unlimited extensions of the lock period. Stakers can repeatedly extend their lock time, as long as they wait for the duration equivalent to 96 cycles.

With each extension of the lock time, the duration of the voting power also increases. This ensures that a voter's influence remains stable, allowing them to consistently vote with unchanged power in future cycles.

Example (Assuming no decay in vote power over time):

1. Initially locked with 100 votes for 96 cycles.
2. 70 votes are cast.
3. Lock is extended for another 96 cycles.
4. 90 votes are cast in the second period, resulting in a total of 160 votes (not limited to the original 100).


## Impact

Stakers can amplify their voting power simply by extending the lock duration instead of locking additional CVG tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set limits on how many times and for how long lock periods can be extended. To lock for longer, more CVG tokens should be required.
