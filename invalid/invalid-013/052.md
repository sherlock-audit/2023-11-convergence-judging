# Users can potentially mint a locking position for free due to unchecked transferfrom return value

## Summary
When minting a locking position in [LockingPositionService.mintPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Locking/LockingPositionService.sol#L231) , dev transfer cvg from sender to the contract , user can potentially mint a locking position for free when calling that function.

## Vulnerability Detail
cvg is an ERC20 with transferfrom function that returns a bool indicating a success or failure. mintPosition() fails to check that return value, so an user can potentially mint a position for free if something unexpected happens when executing the cvg.transferffrom line of code. Specifically if something goes wrong , transferfrom will throw false instead of reverting, and user will be able to mint a locking position for free.

## Impact
User can mint a locking position for free .
