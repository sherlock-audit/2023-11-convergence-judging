# ```withdrawSdt``` function should use ```safeTransfer``` to prevent ERC20 transfers from silently failing.

## Summary

In the  [```withdrawSdt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol#L104-L115) function of the [```SdtFeeCollector```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol) contract, the ```transfer``` method is used on IERC20 ```sdt``` instead of the ```safeTransfer``` method, meaning there is a risk this transfers silently fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the  [```withdrawSdt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol#L104-L115) function of the [```SdtFeeCollector```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol) contract, we use the ```transfer``` method on ```_sdt```.
However, for some ERC20 implementations, this method will not revert in case transfer does not goes through. 

This means the transfer of fees in this function could silently fail (depending on ```sdt``` implementation), leading to the potentially harmful consequences as described below.

## Impact

In case one of these fee transfers fails, this would lead to serious consequences. 
For instance, let us say the ```feeRepartition``` contains two receivers (let's call them ```receiver1``` and ```receiver2```) and the first transfer (for ```receiver1```) goes through -meaning ```feePercentage1``` of the total amount of fees is transferred successfully to ```receiver1```- but the second transfer fails.
In this case, if we call the [```withdrawSdt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol#L104-L115) function a second time, we risk transferring another ```feePercentage1``` of the NEW total amount of fees to ```receiver1``` and ```feePercentage2``` of the NEW total amount of fees to ```receiver2``` (which is then lesser than ```feePercentage2``` of the OLD total amount of fees), meaning ```receiver2``` will then be worse off than initially designed in the ```feeRepartition```.

## Code Snippet

Below is the code of the [```withdrawSdt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol#L104-L115) function of the [```SdtFeeCollector```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol) contract 

```solidity
function withdrawSdt() external {
        IERC20 _sdt = sdt;
        /// @dev Fetches the balance in SDT on the contract
        uint256 balance = _sdt.balanceOf(address(this));
        /// @dev Iterates through the feeRepartitions array
        for (uint256 j; j < feesRepartition.length; ) {
            /// @dev Computes and transfers SDT fees to the iterated receiver
            _sdt.transfer(feesRepartition[j].receiver, (balance * feesRepartition[j].feePercentage) / TOTAL_FEES);
            unchecked {
                ++j;
            }
        }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend using the ```safeTransfer``` function of the [```SafeERC20```](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) library.
In this case, the transfer will revert upon failure and there is no risk it silently fails.

The [```withdrawSdt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtFeeCollector.sol#L104-L115) function would then look like the below

```solidity
function withdrawSdt() external {
        IERC20 _sdt = sdt;
        /// @dev Fetches the balance in SDT on the contract
        uint256 balance = _sdt.balanceOf(address(this));
        /// @dev Iterates through the feeRepartitions array
        for (uint256 j; j < feesRepartition.length; ) {
            /// @dev Computes and transfers SDT fees to the iterated receiver
            _sdt.safeTransfer(feesRepartition[j].receiver, (balance * feesRepartition[j].feePercentage) / TOTAL_FEES);
            unchecked {
                ++j;
            }
        }
}
```
