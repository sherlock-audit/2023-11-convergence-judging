# CvgSDT token loss for users claiming claimCvgSdtRewards or claimCvgSdtMultiple

## Summary
There is a presence of precision loss in [SdtStakingPositionService._claimCvgSdtRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L429C34-L429C34) that will lead to users receiving less staking rewards (CvgSDT).

## Vulnerability Detail
[SdtStakingPositionService._claimCvgSdtRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L429C34-L429C34) internal function that is called by claimCvgSdtRewards and claimCvgSdtMultiple will cause a loss of precision when calculating the _cvgClaimable amount. This [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionService.sol#L466) is where the issue happens.

For example if

- tokenStaked = 157
- _cycleInfo[lastClaimedCycle].cvgRewardsAmount = 100
- totalStaked = 1000
- claimableAmount will be (157*100)/1000 // it will return 15 instead of 15.7 because of solidity truncation

## Impact
Users will get less rewards than they should, on the long run these small amount ( in our example 15.7-15 = 0.7) will be accumulated and will be huge.
