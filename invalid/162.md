# Unprotected initializer can allow unauthorized access or state manipulation in `SdtStakingPositionService` contract

## Summary
The modifier calls a function from another contract that performs the check. However, the modifier is not protected by any modifier or require statement. This can allow unauthorized access or state manipulation in the contract, as the modifier can be called by anyone or bypassed by other functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The modifier `checkCompliance()` is an initializer that checks the compliance of a token ID and the sender. The modifier calls the function `checkTokenFullCompliance()` from the `sdtStakingPositionManager` contract, which performs the check and reverts if the check fails. However, the modifier is not protected by any modifier or require statement, such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyProcessor`. This can allow unauthorized access or state manipulation in the contract, as the modifier can be called by anyone or bypassed by other functions. For example, an attacker can call the modifier with a malicious token ID or sender and cause the contract to revert or execute unwanted logic. Alternatively, a function that uses the modifier can be called without the modifier and skip the compliance check.

## Impact
Unprotected initializer can have serious consequences for the security and functionality of the contract. For example, if the modifier is called by an unauthorized user or bypassed by a function, the contract can be vulnerable to attacks, such as denial-of-service, re-entrancy, or front-running. Moreover, the contract can also violate the compliance rules and the governance of the contract, as the modifier is supposed to enforce the compliance check for the token ID and the sender.

- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent unauthorized access or state manipulation, protect the initializer with a modifier or a require statement. Use a modifier or a require statement that checks the callerâ€™s role or permission, such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyProcessor`. 
```diff
modifier checkCompliance(uint256 tokenId) {
        // Fixed line: protected initializer
+      require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == processor, "NOT_AUTHORIZED");
        sdtStakingPositionManager.checkTokenFullCompliance(tokenId, msg.sender);
        _;
    }
