# CVG Rewards Accumulation is at Risk

## Summary
Allowing rewards to be greater than the total staked amount can lead to unexpected and potentially undesirable outcomes. In typical scenarios, rewards are distributed based on the proportion of an individual's staked amount relative to the total staked amount. If the rewards exceed the total staked amount, it may result in a situation where the claimed rewards are disproportionate to the actual staked amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation lacks explicit checks to prevent CVG rewards from exceeding the total staked amount during the calculation of claimable rewards. This oversight could lead to unintended scenarios where users may claim more rewards than the actual total staked, potentially impacting the fairness and integrity of the reward distribution system.

Suppose a user has a staked amount of 100 tokens, and the CVG rewards allocated for the cycle are 120. If, for some reason, the total staked amount for that cycle is mistakenly recorded as 80, the calculation would result in claimable rewards (150) surpassing the actual total staked amount. This scenario could allow users to claim more rewards than the system's intended distribution.

This finding is likely a High because the reward is at rewards and the reward of a user will be higher than whatever he has staked, here is a scenario:

Suppose a user, Alice, participates in a staking protocol with the following conditions:

Alice has staked 100 tokens in a cycle.
The total staked amount recorded for that cycle is erroneously set to 80 tokens.
The protocol allocates 120 CVG rewards for distribution in that cycle.
In this scenario, the vulnerability allows Alice to claim rewards based on the miscalculated claimable rewards, which exceed the actual total staked amount.

Calculations:

Claimable Rewards = (Alice's Staked Amount * Total CVG Rewards) / Total Staked
Claimable Rewards = (100 * 120) / 80 = 150
Impact:

Alice claims 150 CVG rewards, even though the total staked amount for that cycle is only 80 tokens.
The protocol unintentionally distributes more rewards than the actual total staked, leading to an imbalance in the reward distribution.
Loss of Funds:

The excess 70 CVG rewards (150 - 80) were not justified by the actual staked amount.
The protocol incurs a loss equal to the additional rewards distributed, impacting the overall integrity of the reward distribution system.

## Impact
The vulnerability introduces a risk of unjustly distributing rewards, potentially leading to inconsistencies and unfair advantages for users. It could undermine the integrity of the reward distribution mechanism, affecting the overall user experience and the protocol's reputation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement explicit checks: Introduce checks in the reward calculation logic to ensure that the claimable rewards do not exceed the total staked amount.
Bound checks: Consider setting bounds on the claimable rewards to prevent unexpected scenarios, such as rewards surpassing the total staked amount.
When designing a reward distribution system, it's crucial to prioritize fairness, transparency, and security. Consider incorporating mechanisms like rate limiting, dynamic adjustments based on total staked amounts, and thorough testing to enhance the robustness of the reward calculation process.
