# Missing event in setter function can reduce transparency and auditability in `LockingPositionManager` contract

## Summary
The code snippet is a function that sets the base URI for the token metadata. The function updates the state variable `baseURI` but does not emit any event when the state variable is changed. This can reduce the transparency and auditability of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `setBaseURI()` is a setter function that updates the state variable `baseURI`. This variable is used to construct the token URI for each token ID. The function is only callable by the owner of the contract. However, the function does not emit any event when the state variable is changed. This can reduce the transparency and auditability of the contract, as it makes it harder to track and verify the changes in the contract state.

## Impact
Missing events in setter functions can have negative consequences for the functionality and security of the contract. For example, if the owner changes the state variable without emitting events, then the users and the other contracts may not be aware of the changes and may rely on outdated or incorrect information. Moreover, missing events can also make it harder to debug and test the contract, as it reduces the visibility and traceability of the contract behavior.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To improve the transparency and auditability of the contract, emit events in setter functions when the state variables are changed. The events should include the old and the new values of the state variables, as well as the address of the caller.
```diff
// Define event for state variable change 
+       event BaseURIChanged(string oldBaseURI, string newBaseURI, address indexed caller);

         function setBaseURI(string memory _newBaseURI) external onlyOwner {
                  // Emit event when baseURI is changed
+                  emit BaseURIChanged(baseURI, _newBaseURI, msg.sender);
                    baseURI = _newBaseURI;
    }

```
