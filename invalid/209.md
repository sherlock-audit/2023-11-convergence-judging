# Tokens distribution may be broken due to incorrect address verification when depositing tokens

## Summary
According to the documentation the `YsDistributor.depositMultipleToken` function is only usable by this multisig and will update the amount of ERC20 tokens available as rewards for the Locking position holding ysCvg. If a token has already been set up for a TDE, it will add the amount to the previous one. But in case the `deposits` contains the same addresses the token address will be added again because the last added tokens are not checked. This way some users will receive an excess amount of tokens and the other part will receive less than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositedTokenAddressForTde` array is cached before the for loop which reads calldata. The internal for loop checks if the cached array contains an address. If the address is absent it is added to the `depositedTokenAddressForTde` array. But the cached array is not updated and the cached length is not incremented. So the last added addresses will not be checked on the next cycles of the external for loop.
```solidity
        address[] memory _tokens = depositedTokenAddressForTde[_actualTDE];
        uint256 tokensLength = _tokens.length;

        for (uint256 i; i < deposits.length; ) {
            IERC20 _token = deposits[i].token;
            uint256 _amount = deposits[i].amount;

            depositedTokenAmountForTde[_actualTDE][_token] += _amount;

            /// @dev Checks whether the token is present in depositedTokenAddressForTde, otherwise we add it.
            bool found;
            for (uint256 j; j < tokensLength; ) {
                if (address(_token) == _tokens[j]) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
                unchecked {
                    ++j;
                }
            }

            if (!found) {
                depositedTokenAddressForTde[_actualTDE].push(address(_token));
            }
```
The reward amount calculation for a token depends on the share of the user and is determined as a part of the token amount saved at the ` depositedTokenAmountForTde[_actualTDE][_token]` mapping.

For duplicated addresses users shares will be distributed several times.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider updating the cached array and incrementing the `tokensLength` variable when a new token is added.
```diff
            if (!found) {
                depositedTokenAddressForTde[_actualTDE].push(address(_token));
+               _tokens.push(address(_token));
+               ++tokensLength;
            }
```
