# Arbitrary call vulnerability can allow malicious contracts to execute any function in `SdtStakingPositionService` contract

## Severity
- Critical

## Summary
The code snippet is a function that calls a low-level function on a contract address with a function signature and arguments. The function is used to withdraw funds from the vault to the user. However, the contract address, the function signature, and the arguments are not validated or restricted. This can allow malicious contracts to execute any function in the contract, such as transferring tokens, changing state variables, or calling other contracts. 


## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_callWithSignature()` calls a low-level function on a contract address with a function signature and arguments at line 810. The function is used to withdraw funds from the vault to the user. The function takes an amount as a parameter and encodes it with the function signature and the sender address. The function then calls the call() function on the contract address with the encoded data. However, the contract address, the function signature, and the arguments are not validated or restricted. The contract address is stored in the state variable `withdrawCallInfo.addr`, which is set in the `initialize()` function. The function signature is stored in the state variable `withdrawCallInfo.signature`, which is also set in the `initialize()` function. The arguments are the sender address and the amount, which are provided by the user or the processor. This can allow malicious contracts to execute any function in the contract, such as transferring tokens, changing state variables, or calling other contracts. For example, an attacker can set the contract address to the `SdtStakingPositionService` contract itself, the function signature to a malicious function, and the arguments to arbitrary values. The attacker can then call the `_callWithSignature()` function and execute the malicious function in the contract.

## Impact
Arbitrary call vulnerability can have devastating consequences for the security and functionality of the contract. For example, if a malicious contract can execute any function in the contract, it can perform unauthorized actions, such as transferring tokens, changing state variables, or calling other contracts. This can result in a loss of funds, a breach of compliance, or a compromise of the contract logic. Moreover, the malicious contract can also exploit the contract logic and bypass some checks or validations.

```solidity
function _callWithSignature(uint256 _amount) internal {
        /// @dev Call the vault contract with the function described in the signature
        ///      The receiver is always the msg.sender of the tx
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        // Vulnerable line: calling a low-level function on a contract address with a function signature and arguments
        (bool success, ) = withdrawCallInfo.addr.call(
            abi.encodePacked(withdrawCallInfo.signature, abi.encode(msg.sender), abi.encode(_amount))
        );
        require(success, "Failed to withdraw");
    }

```
## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent arbitrary call vulnerability, validate or restrict the contract address, the function signature, and the arguments. Use a modifier or a require statement that checks the contract address, the function signature, and the arguments against a whitelist or a range of values.
```diff
// Define a whitelist of allowed contract addresses
address[] public allowedAddresses;

// Define a whitelist of allowed function signatures
bytes4[] public allowedSignatures;

function _callWithSignature(uint256 _amount) internal {
        /// @dev Call the vault contract with the function described in the signature
        ///      The receiver is always the msg.sender of the tx
        // Fixed line: validating the contract address, the function signature, and the arguments
+        require(allowedAddresses.contains(withdrawCallInfo.addr), "INVALID_ADDRESS");
+       require(allowedSignatures.contains(withdrawCallInfo.signature), "INVALID_SIGNATURE");
+        require(_amount > 0 && _amount <= withdrawCallInfo.maxAmount, "INVALID_AMOUNT");
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        (bool success, ) = withdrawCallInfo.addr.call(
            abi.encodePacked(withdrawCallInfo.signature, abi.encode(msg.sender), abi.encode(_amount))
        );
        require(success, "Failed to withdraw");
    }
