# Unsafe use of transfer() in burnPosition

## Summary

The `burnPosition` function in `LockingPositionService` contains a potential vulnerability related to the direct use of the `transfer` function for the CVG token. This operation might not revert on failure but instead returns a boolean value. The code lacks a check on the success of the transfer, which could potentially lead to funds being lost or the operation being considered successful even if it fails.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `burnPosition` function, the following code is used for transferring CVG tokens back to the user:

```solidity
cvg.transfer(msg.sender, totalCvgLocked);
```

This direct use of the transfer function might not revert on failure but instead returns a boolean value. The code lacks a check on the success of the transfer, which could potentially lead to funds being lost or the operation being considered successful even if it fails.

## Impact

If the CVG token's `transfer` function fails, the user may lose funds, and the failure might go unnoticed, affecting the overall functionality and security of the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function burnPosition(uint256 tokenId) external {
      _checkTokenOwnerShip(tokenId, address(0));
      ICvgControlTower _cvgControlTower = cvgControlTower;
      uint256 lastEndCycle = lockingPositions[tokenId].lastEndCycle;
      uint256 ysPercentage = lockingPositions[tokenId].ysPercentage;
      uint256 totalCvgLocked = lockingPositions[tokenId].totalCvgLocked;

      require(_cvgControlTower.cvgCycle() > lastEndCycle, "LOCKED");

      /** @dev  if the position contains veCvg , we must remove it from the voting escrow */
      if (ysPercentage != MAX_PERCENTAGE) {
          _cvgControlTower.votingPowerEscrow().withdraw(tokenId);
      }

      /** @dev Burn the NFT representing the position. */
      _cvgControlTower.lockingPositionManager().burn(tokenId);

      /** @dev Transfer CVG back to the user. */
      cvg.transfer(msg.sender, totalCvgLocked); // @audit this line has issue

      emit LockingPositionBurn(tokenId);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update the token transfer operation in the `burnPosition` function to use a pattern that checks for success and reverts if the transfer fails. Consider adopting a pattern similar to OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library:

```solidity
bool success = cvg.transfer(msg.sender, totalCvgLocked);
require(success, "CVG transfer failed");
```
