# Potential loss of bribe in SdtBlackHole

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`SdtBlackHole` transfers bribe to `sdtRewardReceiver`.

Inside `CvgControlTower.sol` there is no guarantee that `sdtRewardReceiver` will always have a non-zero address.

Hence when transfer is called inside `SdtBlackHole` and if `sdtRewardReceiver` is the zero address, this will result in loss of bribe tokens.
