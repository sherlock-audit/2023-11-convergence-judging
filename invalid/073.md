# Malicious user can vote with more power than he has

## Summary
In GaugeController contract the voting functionality doesn't check to see if user has enough voting power 

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can receive voting power by calling `LockingPositionService::mintPosition()`  the more tokens they deposit the more voting power will be allocated to them, voting power of each user can be returned by calling `veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress` function and this power can be used in GaugeController contract to vote on gauge weight. 

users can call `multi_vote` and `simple_vote` functions  to vote and pass the weight (power) that they want to use but the **problem is in `vote_for_gauge_weights` function which is called in this functions the passed `_user_weight`  is not checked to see if the caller really has the passed power or not**.

## Impact
Since users can get voting power by depositing any amount even 1 wei, a malicious user can deposit very small amount of token to just get the new minted token (because vote_for_gauge_weights function only check to see if caller is owner or delegated of the passed token), So after this he can call `simple_vote` to vote on gauge with the power that he don't have.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
you need to check the passed `_user_weight`  against `veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress`  function
```diff
+    lockingService: LockingPositionService = self.control_tower.lockingPositionService()
+    assert (_user_weight <= lockingService.veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress(msg.sender)), "not enough power"
```
