# Duplicate Bond Asset Withdrawals in BondDepository

## Summary
`withdraw` function in `BondDepository` allows withdrawing bonded assets to a user, but does not burn or invalidate the user's bond NFT. This could allow duplicate withdrawals using the same NFT.

It does not consider the associated bond NFT or update its state to reflect the withdrawal.

This is because its only responsibility is withdrawing from a linked `SdtStakingPositionService`. 

So it overlooks the need to invalidate the bond NFT as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdraw` function transfers bonded assets to the user but does not burn or update the bond NFT. This allows users to withdraw multiple times with the same NFT.

- This `withdraw` function is used to withdraw staked assets from an associated `SdtStakingPositionService` contract: [Line 86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/StakeDAO/SdtBlackHole.sol#L86)

```solidity
ISdtStakingPositionService(msg.sender).stakingAsset().transfer(receiver, amount); 
```

- It takes the `amount` to withdraw and sends it to the `receiver` address.

- However, it does not interact with or burn the user's bond NFT in any way. 

- The `BondDepository` contract is responsible for managing bond NFTs via functions like `deposit`, `redeem`, `claim`.

- But this `withdraw` function is narrowly focused on just transferring staked assets.

The issue is:

- Because the bond NFT is not invalidated, a user could withdraw their bonded assets using this function.

- Then later call `redeem` or `claim` again with the same NFT and withdraw a second time.

- Essentially they can withdraw double the assets while still holding their original bond NFT.

## Impact
- Users can withdraw multiples of their original bonded assets.
- Loss of protocol reserves due to duplicate withdrawals.
- Impact scales exponentially with number of duplicate withdrawals.

Let's look at an example:

1. Alice deposits 100 TOKEN into a Bond and gets Bond NFT 1

2. Later she calls `withdraw` to get her 100 TOKEN back

3. The 100 TOKEN is transferred out via `withdraw`

4. But Alice still holds Bond NFT 1 which represents a claim on those 100 TOKEN

5. Alice can now call `redeem` or `claim` again with NFT 1 to withdraw another 100 TOKEN
  
6. She has withdrawn 200 TOKEN total while only depositing 100 TOKEN originally

The risk is that Alice repeatedly calls `withdraw` and other functions using the same Bond NFT and withdraws many multiples of her original deposit.

For example, calling withdraw 10 times would allow her to withdraw 10x her original bonded assets.

The NFT is not invalidated after `withdraw`.

```solidity
function withdraw(address receiver, uint256 amount) external {

  // Transfer assets 
  ISdtStakingPositionService(msg.sender).stakingAsset().transfer(receiver, amount);

  // NFT not burned or updated

}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider burning or transferring bond NFT on `withdraw`.

- Or separate narrow asset withdrawal function from broader NFT-aware `withdraw`.
