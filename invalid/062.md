# User can bypass the `_updateAmountStakedWithdraw` and withdrawl before the next cycle

## Summary
The _updateAmountStakedWithdraw function lacks an explicit mechanism for enforcing a withdrawal delay, potentially allowing users to bypass withdrawal restrictions. The function handles withdrawal logic based on the current cycle and pending amounts without incorporating a specific delay feature

## Vulnerability Detail
When a tries to withdraw he calls the withdraw function and the external function _updateAmountStakedWithdraw is called upon
```solidity
 function withdraw(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external checkCompliance(tokenId) {
        require(amount != 0, "WITHDRAW_LTE_0");

        uint256 _cvgStakingCycle = stakingCycle;

        /// @dev Update the CycleInfo & the TokenInfo for the current & next cycle
        _updateAmountStakedWithdraw(tokenId, amount, _cvgStakingCycle);

        /// @dev Calls in low level the function withdrawing funds from the vault to the user
        _callWithSignature(amount);

        emit Withdraw(tokenId, msg.sender, _cvgStakingCycle, amount);
    }
   ```
In a typical staking system, it's common to have a mechanism to track withdrawal requests. Users may request to withdraw a certain amount, but the actual withdrawal is processed at a later time (usually after a waiting period or at the end of a specific cycle). During this waiting period, the requested amount is considered pending. A malicious user can adequately withdraw before the next cycle.

Since the intention of the contract is to allow users to request withdrawals for a given cycle.
```solidity
function _updateAmountStakedWithdraw(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, uint256 currentCycle) internal {
        uint256 nextCycle = currentCycle + 1;
        /// @dev get pending staked amount not already eligible for rewards
        uint256 nextCyclePending = _tokenInfoByCycle[nextCycle][tokenId].pendingStaked;
        /// @dev Get amount already staked on the token when the last operation occurred
        uint256 _tokenTotalStaked = tokenTotalStaked(tokenId);

        /// @dev Verify that the withdrawn amount is lower than the total staked amount
        require(amount <= _tokenTotalStaked, "WITHDRAW_EXCEEDS_STAKED_AMOUNT");
        uint256 _newTokenStakedAmount = _tokenTotalStaked - amount;

        /// @dev update last amountStaked for current cycle
        uint256 _lastActionCycle = _stakingHistoryByToken[tokenId][_stakingHistoryByToken[tokenId].length - 1];

        /// @dev if this _lastActionCycle is less than the current cycle =>
        ///      No deposits occurred on the last cycle & no withdraw on this cycle
        if (_lastActionCycle < currentCycle) {
            /// @dev we have so to checkpoint the current cycle
            _stakingHistoryByToken[tokenId].push(currentCycle);
            /// @dev and to report the amountStaked of the lastActionCycle to the currentCycle
            _tokenInfoByCycle[currentCycle][tokenId].amountStaked = _tokenInfoByCycle[_lastActionCycle][tokenId]
                .amountStaked;
        }

        /// @dev updates the amount staked for this position for the next cycle
        _tokenInfoByCycle[nextCycle][tokenId].amountStaked = _newTokenStakedAmount;

        /// @dev Fully removes the amount from the totalStaked of next cycle.
        ///      This withdrawn amount is not anymore eligible to the distribution of the next cycle.
        _cycleInfo[nextCycle].totalStaked -= amount;

        /// @dev If there is some token deposited on this cycle ( pending token )
        ///      We first must to remove them before the tokens that are already accumulating rewards
        if (nextCyclePending != 0) {
            /// @dev If the amount to withdraw is lower or equal to the pending amount
            if (nextCyclePending >= amount) {
                /// @dev we decrement this pending amount
                _tokenInfoByCycle[nextCycle][tokenId].pendingStaked -= amount;
            }
            /// @dev Else, the amount to withdraw is greater than the pending
            else {
                /// @dev Computes the amount to remove from the staked amount eligible to rewards
                uint256 _amount = amount - nextCyclePending;

                /// @dev Fully removes the pending amount for next cycle
                delete _tokenInfoByCycle[nextCycle][tokenId].pendingStaked;

                /// @dev Removes the adjusted amount to the staked total amount eligible to rewards
                _cycleInfo[currentCycle].totalStaked -= _amount;

                /// @dev Removes the adjusted amount to the staked position amount eligible to rewards
                _tokenInfoByCycle[currentCycle][tokenId].amountStaked -= _amount;
            }
        }
        /// @dev If nothing has been desposited on this cycle
        else {
            /// @dev removes the withdrawn amount to the staked total amount eligible to rewards
            _cycleInfo[currentCycle].totalStaked -= amount;
            /// @dev removes the withdrawn amount to the staked token amount eligible to rewards
            _tokenInfoByCycle[currentCycle][tokenId].amountStaked -= amount;
        }
    }
```
## POC
```solidity
// Assume the following simplified version of the contract
contract StakingContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakedAmounts;
    mapping(address => uint256) public withdrawalCycles;

    uint256 public currentCycle;

    function _updateAmountStakedWithdraw(address user) internal {
        // Simplified logic without withdrawal delay enforcement
        uint256 pendingAmount = stakedAmounts[user];
        uint256 lastWithdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycles[user];

        // Check if the user has a pending amount to withdraw
        if (pendingAmount > 0) {
            // Check if the last withdrawal cycle is less than the current cycle (no withdrawal delay check)
            if (lastWithdrawalCycle < currentCycle) {
                // Process the withdrawal without enforcing a delay
                // This is the vulnerable part of the logic
                // Users can potentially withdraw immediately without waiting for a predefined delay
                // ...

                // Update the last withdrawal cycle to the current cycle
                withdrawalCycles[user] = currentCycle;
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example of potential misuse by a user
contract MaliciousUser {
    StakingContract public stakingContract;

    constructor(StakingContract _stakingContract) {
        stakingContract = _stakingContract;
    }

    // Function to exploit the vulnerability and withdraw immediately
    function exploitVulnerability() external {
        // Assume the user has previously staked some amount
        address user = msg.sender;

        // Simulate staking an amount
        stakingContract.stakedAmounts[user] = 100;

        // Simulate the user's last withdrawal cycle being behind the current cycle
        stakingContract.withdrawalCycles[user] = stakingContract.currentCycle - 1;

        // Call the vulnerable function to withdraw without delay
        stakingContract._updateAmountStakedWithdraw(user);
    }
}
```
In this example, the StakingContract lacks a proper withdrawal delay enforcement mechanism. The exploitVulnerability function in the MaliciousUser contract takes advantage of this by setting the last withdrawal cycle to a value less than the current cycle, effectively bypassing any withdrawal delay and allowing immediate withdrawal
## Impact
The absence of a withdrawal delay mechanism introduces a vulnerability where users may exploit the system to withdraw their staked amounts without adhering to any predefined delay. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as disrupting the intended staking and withdrawal process, potentially impacting the system's stability and fairness.
This likelihood is High because if a user keeps having the power to withdraw before the next cycle there would be nothing for other users who want to withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You might want to consider adding a withdrawal request mechanism. This would involve storing withdrawal requests for each user, and then processing those requests at a designated time, such as the end of a cycle.
