# FrontRunning NFT sell by locking it to maxLockingTime

## Summary

NFTs represent staking positions with associated rewards. The protocol's `setLock` function, designed to secure these NFTs by preventing front-running reward claims. However, a seller can manipulate this lock period, misleading a buyer about the NFT's availability for reward claims.

## Vulnerability Detail
`setLock` function is intended to add a time lock to an NFT, ensuring that the seller cannot claim rewards during the sale process, thus protecting the buyer's interests. However, the current implementation allows the NFT owner to extend the lock time just before a sale, potentially trapping the NFT in an extended lock state unknown to the buyer.

```solidity
function setLock(uint256 tokenId, uint256 timestamp) external onlyNftOwner(tokenId) {
    require(timestamp >= block.timestamp + BUFFER, "TIME_BUFFER"); // Min lock duration
    require(timestamp - block.timestamp < maxLockingTime, "MAX_TIME_LOCK"); // Max lock duration
    if (unlockingTimestampPerToken[tokenId] != 0) {
        require(timestamp > unlockingTimestampPerToken[tokenId], "ALREADY_LOCKED"); // Extend existing lock
    }
    unlockingTimestampPerToken[tokenId] = timestamp;
}
```

**Misuse Scenario:** Alice initially sets a one-day lock to reassure Bob which is a potential buyer. Right before the sale, Alice maliciously extends the lock to the maximum allowed period (e.g., 10 days). This action leaves Bob the buyer with a locked NFT for an extended duration, contrary to their expectation of a shorter lock.

## Impact

Buyers may be misled about the NFT's lock duration, affecting their purchasing decisions and the unexpected extended lock period reduces the NFT's liquidity and utility for the buyer.
