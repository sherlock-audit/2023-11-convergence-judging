# Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint`

## Summary

The protocol mints ERC721 tokens to arbitrary addresses without checking if they're able to manage such tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol doesn't verify that receivers of an ERC721 token, minted by the protocol, are able to correctly handle ERC721 tokens in the case in which the receiver is an account with code deployed to it. As a result, the ERC721 positions may be lost forever, as there's no mechanism for an authorized actor to burn an ERC721 token on behalf of its owner.

## Impact

ERC721 tokens may be lost forever

## Code Snippet

[LockingPositionManager.sol#mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Locking/LockingPositionManager.sol#L59-L61)
[SdtStakingPositionManager.sol#mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Staking/StakeDAO/SdtStakingPositionManager.sol#L137-L146)

Although it is out of scope for the current contest, I find it relevant to mention that this issue also affects the `BondPositionManager` contract:
[BondPositionManager.sol#mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Bond/BondPositionManager.sol#L63-L67)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` in all Manager contracts.
