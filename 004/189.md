# User's can attain unlimited `veCvg/mgCvg` voting power due to lack of duplication checks

## Summary
User's can attain unlimited `veCvg/mgCvg` voting power due to lack of duplication checks

## Vulnerability Detail
The `manageOwnedAndDelegated` function doesn't check for duplication among the added tokens. This allows an user to add for oneself the same token infinite number of times.
The `mgCvgVotingPowerPerAddress` and `veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress` functions which are used to compute the voting power from the `tokenOwnedAndDelegated` which was previously set by `manageOwnedAndDelegated` also doesn't check for duplication. This allows a user to gain infinite governance power.

## Impact
Attackers can gain unlimited voting power on governance disrupting the entire protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for duplication in the all arrays.
Since this is being set externally and the newly minted tokens having the latest tokenId, enforcing an increasing tokenId in arrays can solve this issue.

```diff
+++     uint prevTokenId;
        for (uint256 i; i < _ownedAndDelegatedTokens.owneds.length;) {
+++         require(_ownedAndDelegatedTokens.owneds[i] > prevTokenId);
            /** @dev Check if tokenId is owned by the user.*/
            require(
                msg.sender == cvgControlTower.lockingPositionManager().ownerOf(_ownedAndDelegatedTokens.owneds[i]),
                "TOKEN_NOT_OWNED"
            );
            tokenOwnedAndDelegated[msg.sender].owneds.push(_ownedAndDelegatedTokens.owneds[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
Similarly for the other 2 arrays
