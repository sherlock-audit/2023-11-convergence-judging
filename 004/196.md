# `LockingPositionService`'s voting power can be inflated by putting duplicated entries to `LockingPositionDelegate.tokenOwnedAndDelegated`

## Summary

A malicious user can put duplicated entries to `LockingPositionDelegate.tokenOwnedAndDelegated` and get more voting power (`LockingPositionService.veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress()` or `LockingPositionService.mgCvgVotingPowerPerAddress()`) than what they should get, therefore potentially rig the Cvg-governance or Meta-governance.


## Vulnerability Detail

`LockingPositionService.veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress` uses the returned arrays from `LockingPostionDelegate.getTokenVeOwnedAndDelegated`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Locking/LockingPositionService.sol#L732-L733

In the `LockingPositionService.veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress`, the returned arrays will be checked in loops and the voting power will be counted for the user.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Locking/LockingPositionService.sol#L736-L765

However, `LockingPositionService.veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress` does not check whether certain tokenId is already counted for the user.

The arrays above are coming from `LockingPostionDelegate.tokenOwnedAndDelegated`, which can be updated via `LockingPositionDelegate.manageOwnedAndDelegated` by users.
The function as well does not check whether the given arrays contain duplicated entries.

The same problem occurs with `LockingPositionService.mgCvgVotingPowerPerAddress` as well. Here the function fails to check for duplicated entries and will simply add voting powers even if there are any duplicated entries

## Impact

According to the comments, these functions
`LockingPositionService.mgCvgVotingPowerPerAddress`
and
`LockingPositionService.veCvgVotingPowerPerAddress`
are used in Meta-governance strategy and Cvg Governance proposal strategy.

A malicious user can manipulate these governances by inflating their voting power.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

in the `LockingPositionDelegate.manageOwnedAndDelegated` function, check and do not allow to have duplicates.
