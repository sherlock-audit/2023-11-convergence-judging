# assignment before zero check

## Summary
assignment was done to state variables  before a zero check on the  initialize function in CvgRewards.initialize .
this means the state variables are already set even if the require fails
## Vulnerability Detail
an attacker can manipulate state variables without checks
## Impact
protocol insolvency
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-convergence/blob/main/sherlock-cvg/contracts/Rewards/CvgRewards.sol#L100-L112
  function initialize(ICvgControlTower _cvgControlTower) external initializer {
        cvgControlTower = _cvgControlTower;
        address _treasuryDao = _cvgControlTower.treasuryDao();
        require(_treasuryDao != address(0), "TREASURY_DAO_ZERO");
        _transferOwnership(_treasuryDao);
        lastUpdatedTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        cvgRewardsConfig = CvgRewardsConfig({
            maxChunkCheckpoint: 50,
            maxLoopSetTotalWeight: 50,
            maxChunkDistribute: 50
        });
        inflationRatio = 10_000;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the zero checks should be before assignments
